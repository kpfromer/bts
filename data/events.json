    "headlinerBio": "Calvin Cordozar Broadus, Jr. (born October 20, 1971), known professionally as Snoop Dogg, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, television personality and actor. His music career began in 1992 when he was discovered by Dr. Dre and featured on Dre's solo debut, \"Deep Cover\", and then on Dre's solo debut album, The Chronic. He has since sold over 23 million albums in the United States and 35 million albums worldwide.  Snoop's debut album, Doggystyle, produced by Dr. Dre and released in 1993 by Death Row Records, debuted at number one on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Selling almost a million copies in the first week of its release, Doggystyle became certified 4× platinum in 1994 and spawned several hit singles, including \"What's My Name?\" and \"Gin & Juice\". In 1994 Snoop released a soundtrack on Death Row Records for the short film Murder Was the Case, starring himself. His second album, Tha Doggfather (1996), also debuted at number one on both charts, with \"Snoop's Upside Ya Head\" as the lead single. The album was certified double platinum in 1997.  After leaving Death Row Records, Snoop signed with No Limit Records, where he recorded his next three albums, Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998), No Limit Top Dogg (1999), and Tha Last Meal (2000). Snoop then signed with Priority/Capitol/EMI Records in 2002, where he released Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss. He then signed with Geffen Records in 2004 for his next three albums, R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, and Ego Trippin'. Malice 'n Wonderland (2009), and Doggumentary (2011) were released on Priority. Snoop Dogg has starred in motion pictures and hosted several television shows, including Doggy Fizzle Televizzle, Snoop Dogg's Father Hood, and Dogg After Dark. He also coaches a youth football league and high school football team. In September 2009 Snoop was hired by EMI as the chairman of a reactivated Priority Records.  In 2012, after a trip to Jamaica, Snoop announced a conversion to Rastafarianism and a new alias, Snoop Lion. As Snoop Lion he released a reggae album, Reincarnated, and a documentary film of the same name, about his Jamaican experience, in early 2013. His 13th studio album, Bush, was released in May 2015 and marked a return of the Snoop Dogg name. His 14th solo studio album, Coolaid, was released in July 2016. Snoop has 17 Grammy nominations without a win. In March 2016, the night before WrestleMania 32 in Arlington, Texas, he was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame, having made several appearances for the company, including as Master of Ceremonies during a match at WrestleMania XXIV. In 2018, he released his first gospel album, Bible of Love.  Kool Moe Dee ranks Snoop at No. 33 in his book There's a God on the Mic, and says he has \"an ultra-smooth, laidback delivery\" and \"flavor-filled melodic rhyming\". Peter Shapiro describes Snoop's delivery as a \"molasses drawl\" and AllMusic notes his \"drawled, laconic rhyming\" style. Kool Moe Dee refers to Snoop's use of vocabulary, saying he \"keeps it real simple...he simplifies it and he's effective in his simplicity\".  Snoop is known to freestyle some of his lyrics on the spot for some songs – in the book How to Rap, Lady of Rage says, \"Snoop Dogg, when I worked with him earlier in his career, that's how created his stuff... he would freestyle, he wasn't a writer then, he was a freestyler,\" and The D.O.C. states, \"Snoop's [rap] was a one take willy, but his shit was all freestyle. He hadn't written nothing down. He just came in and started busting. The song was \"Tha Shiznit\"—that was all freestyle. He started busting and when we got to the break, Dre cut the machine off, did the chorus and told Snoop to come back in. He did that throughout the record. That's when Snoop was in the zone then.\"  Peter Shapiro says that Snoop debuted on \"Deep Cover\" with a \"shockingly original flow – which sounded like a Slick Rick born in South Carolina instead of South London\" and adds that he \"showed where his style came from by covering Slick Rick's 'La Di Da Di'\". Referring to Snoop's flow, Kool Moe Dee calls him \"one of the smoothest, funkiest flow-ers in the game\". How to Rap also notes that Snoop is known to use syncopation in his flow to give it a laidback quality, as well as 'linking with rhythm' in his compound rhymes, using alliteration, and employing a \"sparse\" flow with good use of pauses.  Snoop re-popularized the use of -izzle speak, particularly in the pop and hip-hop music industry. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Snoop+Dogg\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Stick Figure is a reggae band from California. All music is created by singer Scott Woodruff. Until 2009 he lived in Duxbury, Massachusetts, as Stick Figure all alone. After a long trip to NZ and Bali, he 2011 moved to San Diego to put together a band. 2012 he released the 5th Stick Figure album, Burial Ground. It reached no. 1 on iTunes and Billboard Reggae charts, and has songs as 'Breathe' and 'Weight Of Sound (feat. TJ O'Neill) '. The band then toured in USA with other reggae groups. (Rebelution, The Green, Passafire, Tribal Seeds, The Expendables). The 6th album, Set In Stone (2015) included collaborations with Collie Buddz (the song 'Smokin’ Love (ft. Collie Buddz)'). Also with Eric Rachmany and Slightly Stoopid. Again they topped Billboard Reggae Albums Chart. _   _   _  Possessing a unique style of music that combines a creative blend of upbeat roots reggae with the reverberating echoes of dub, comes a man with no limit for his musical abilities. Stick Figure's music is written, recorded, and produced by Scott Woodruff, a young man from Duxbury, MA.  All of Stick Figure's songs are made by recording each instrument separately, layering several tracks on top of one another in unison.  Stick Figure recently relocated to Southern California and has picked up three new members for the live band, Brendan Dane (San Diego) on bass, Todd Smith (San Clemente) on drums and Kevin Bong (San Diego) on keys. All are incredible musicians and are surely a great addition to the Stick Figure sound. The band is currently in the process of recording their first debut album together, expecting to drop this Winter.   <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stick+Figure\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Twiddle hails from the hills of Hubbardton Vermont, and has always sought to write and perform music that is diverse and groovin', but also intricate and expressive. In the relatively short time since forming, this quartet's music and songwriting has progressed by leaps without bounds, earning them steadily growing recognition. While tapping many parts of the globe for diverse musical and cultural influences, Twiddle maintains a vibe of modern rock and funk with traditional jazz, classical, reggae, and Latin overtones -- all in the spirit of intertwining improvisation and structure. The band has been able to kick back and find itself at home on whatever stage they've played on, be it at a club, college, downtown park, historic theatre, or rowdy festival. Twiddle's shows are always high energy, but with plenty of time, tempo, and mood changes to keep the ears engaged and the brain wondering what's next. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Twiddle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Umphrey's McGee is a progressive rock / jam band from South Bend, IN now based in Chicago, IL.  They are influenced musically by progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Dream Theater, and Genesis, as well as heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden. The band also identifies The Police, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences. However, there really isn't a style of popular music that Umphrey's does not cover. Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to Paul Simon.  Formed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands.   In mid-1998, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as Divisions and All in Time.  Shortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.  The addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar). Another live album, One Fat Sucka, was released shortly after, containing live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.  Around 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the \"Jimmy Stewart Ballroom\" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions \"Jimmy Stewart.\" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by \"McL\" in the \"Jimmy Stewart writeup\" on the fan message board known as \"The Bort\" at www.umphreaks.com.  2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, Umphrey's was invited to play the first annual Bonnaroo Music Festival which took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date and ended up selling more CDs than any other artist on the bill including Widespread Panic, Trey Anastasio, and Norah Jones.  In October 2002 drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving to attend medical school. After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.    In 2004, the band released the critically-acclaimed album Anchor Drops, recorded in several different studios throughout the Chicago area. Shortly before the release of the album, the band scored a distribution deal for both Anchor Drops and Local Band Does OK, and for the first time, Umphrey's music was available in stores all over the country. Anchor Drops received rave reviews from several high-profile magazines. Umphrey's was booked to play the Bonnaroo Music Festival once again in June but unlike their 2002 performance, this time they would play a coveted late-night spot. The band performed to over 20,000 people, many of whom had never heard the band before. Shortly after in July, Umphrey's was declared by Rolling Stone Magazine to \"have become odds-on favorites in the next-Phish sweepstakes.\"   In April 2006, Umphrey's released their fourth studio effort, Safety in Numbers. They appeared on the late night TV program Jimmy Kimmel Live in May and were featured at many of the major U.S. festivals throughout the summer, playing 129 shows before a three-night stand in Chicago for New Year's Eve. The Bottom Half, an album of leftover tracks from the Safety in Numbers sessions, was released a year later in April, 2007. It was supported with tours of the U.S., Europe, and Japan.    A live double-album titled Live at the Murat was released in October, 2007. The album was recorded over 2 nights at the Egyptian Room in the Murat Centre in Indianapolis, Indiana on April 6-7, 2007. It received a 4-star review from Rolling Stone Magazine. The album also won a Jammy for best live album. Another live double album release came in June 2008, when the band put out Jimmy Stewart 2007. The album consisted entirely of live, improvised \"Jimmy Stewart\" sessions recorded in 2007.  Umphrey's McGee completed work on their next studio album, Mantis, in late 2008. Recorded mainly in Manny Sanchez’s I.V. Lab Studios in Chicago, the band members began by presenting each other with CDs containing hundreds of musical ideas they’d composed over the past dozen years, which were then shifted and trimmed down to the concise tracks that appear on the album. The band’s longtime sound caresser, Kevin Browning, edited and mixed the album's material.   Mantis became available for pre-order on October 27, 2008. Along with the pre-order announcement came information that unique bonus content would be available and more content would unlock depending on how many pre-orders were placed. This unusual method of distribution has been hailed as the \"perfect way to implement a pre-order campaign\" by Reuters.com.  Mantis was released on January 20, 2009. The album marked Umphrey’s second decade together as a band and was the first Umphrey’s album to consist entirely of material never previously performed on the road. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Umphrey%27s+McGee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The core members of Shpongle are Simon Posford and Raja Ram from the United Kingdom, along with many collaborators and guest musicians.  Ott is also credited on all albums.  Their sound is a mix of mainly eastern ethnic samples and western contemporary psychedelic synth music. Posford is responsible for the synth and studio work while Raja Ram contributes with flute arrangements. They are both responsible for the visionary input. According to one interview, they commonly visualize the music together before and during the creation process.  Shpongle's first tune, Vapour Rumours, was released on TIP Records' Infinite Excursions compilation in  1996. Their debut album, Are You Shpongled?, was released 1998 on Twisted Records. The high sound quality, successful mix of samples, instruments and synths along with the story and progress of the music through the album made it one of the most cutting edge releases of that time. Are You Shpongled? and Twisted Records' first downtempo compilation, Eclipse, made a huge impact on the psychedelic trance scene in 1998.  Simon Posford is also known for his solo productions as Hallucinogen and as driving force of the label Twisted Records UK. He is also part of Dub Trees (with Youth and Dubsahara), Celtic Cross (with Youth) and Younger Brother (with Prometheus).   Raja Ram is also a member of 1200 Micrograms (with GMS) and The Infinity Project (with Graham Wood, Anjee Sian and other contributors/collaborators). He was also founder of the indo-prog/raga rock group of the '60s/'70s Quintessence.  The bands lyrics and samples are often about the entheogen Dimethyltryptamine (DMT).  www.shpongle.com http://www.twistedmusic.com/artists/shpongle/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shpongle  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Shpongle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": " Florence + the Machine is a London, UK, art pop band led by singer-songwriter Florence Welch and formed in 2007.  The band consists of:  Florence Welch (vocals), Robert Ackroyd (guitar), Isabella Summers (aka Isa Machine - keyboards), Tom Monger (harp), Mark Saunders (bass, percussion), Christopher Lloyd Hayden (drums, backing vocals), Rusty Bradshaw (keyboard, backing vocals) and Sam White (backing vocals).    Lead singer, Florence Welch, was an art-college drop-out, from Camberwell (London), who was discovered singing Motown covers in a nightclub toilet, drunk.  ”The Machine” name originated with an in-joke between Welch and Summers.  Musically, Florence + The Machine's sound is sometimes referred to as soul-inspired indie rock.  Welch grew up listening to The White Stripes and Kate Bush and says she writes metaphorical songs that are \"stories with consequences and weird morality issues.\"  2008 Florence + The Machine's music has received praise across the British music media, especially from the BBC, who played a large part in their rise to prominence, by bringing them into the spotlight as part of \"BBC Introducing\" (a program to support unsigned artists) - firstly at South By South West (SXSW) in Austin, Texas in March 2008 and later that year (Sept 2008) the band recorded a full session for the BBC at their Maida Vale studios.  2009 - 2010 - first awards and first studio album - \"Lungs\" At the Brit Awards 2009, Florence + The Machine received the Critics' Choice Award at the Brits in the UK. The award was introduced in 2008 (when it was awarded to Adele) and focuses on new and emerging British talent, voted for by a panel of music industry experts.  The band's début album was \"Lungs\" (Jul 2009, Universal), preceded by third single Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up) (Jun 2009, Moshi Moshi).  \"Lungs\" went on to become number one in the UK album charts in January 2010, and won the MasterCard British Album award at the 2010 Brits, where they performed a hugely popular collaboration, You've Got the Dirtee Love (live at The Brit Awards 2010) with Dizzee Rascal - a mix of You've Got the Love, the Candi Staton cover from \"Dog Days Are Over\" (Nov 2008, IAmSound), and Dizzee’s Dirtee Cash (Sept 2009, Dirtee Stank).  2011 - second studio album - \"Ceremonials\" The second album \"Ceremonials\" (31 Oct 2011, Island) - with which Welch was inspired for the title and some themes from a '70s Super 8 film of an art installation, she recalls:  \"... this big procession of kind of coquette-style hippies and all these different coloured robes and masks, and it was all to do with colour, really saturated, brightly coloured pastas and balloons. I saw it a couple years ago, and it was called 'Ceremonials' and then, like, Roman numerals after it. And the word sort of stuck with me, and I think the whole idea of performance ...\".  The album is also influenced by hymns, poems and church bells.  2012 - MTV Unplugged album - \"MTV Unplugged\" In 2012, the band released a live album - \"MTV Unplugged\" (Apr 2012, Universal) - as part of the MTV Unplugged series.

    "headlinerBio": "There are multiple artists/bands with the name Iration:  (1) Iration is a rock/reggae band originally from Hawaii but have since relocated to Santa Barbara, CA, US. In 2007, they recorded and released their first full length album \"No Time for Rest\" at Castaway 7 Studios in Ventura, Ca, which featured one of the last recorded performances by reggae legend Mikey Dread. Their single “Cookie Jar” reached number one in Hawaii on 93.9 DaBeat and was featured on Fuel TV’s Triple Crown of Surfing recap. Their music was also featured on MTV shows Maui Fever and Living Lahaina.  In 2008, they embarked on a US national tour titled “Playboys in Paradise” in support of the band Pepper. They also recently recorded four new songs, two of which were co-written by Grammy Award Winner Charles Brotman. They continue to tour extensively and look forward to bringing their sound to an even larger audience. Albums: 2006 - New Roots ep 2007 - No Time for Rest album 2008 - Sample This ep 2010 - Time Bomb album 2011 - Fresh Grounds ep  (2) Iration is a roots reggae band composed by three brothers which begins in the heart of the Caribbean and marks the spiritual birth of their musical talent. They arrived on the island of Montserrat in the West Indies in October of 1973 as exiles of the Pinochet government and in 1981 they migrated to the United States of America. Iration was born in early 1983 and their first performance was at Ramapo High School's 1986 Talent Show in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. Iration began playing college circuits in the US such as Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, Upsala College, The Bronx, Fort Lee etc. They frequently played at local pubs wirthin the Tri-State area and a leg of the Reggae Sunsplash in Greensboro, North Carolina on Sept. 21st, 1991 opening up for J.C. Lodge, Mojo Nya, Truth and Rights and Art Awareness Ensemble.   In April of 1992 they landed in Kingston, Jamaica to record their first single titled “The Day After” published by Mission 101 Records. Iration is the first reggae group to have recorded professionally under this name and they performed live at the Midnite Ravers show in NYC & were interviewed at the Hapte Selassie show on WBAI Pacifica Radio FM.  The single \"The Day After\" received extensive airplay throughout the caribbean radio programs in Manhattan, Queens and The Bronx including 1190 AM.  In mid 1993 Iration returned to their native land to promote their single extensively and this visit unexpectedly became a semi-permanent one.  It was a time of tension where most who rerturned from exile were called \"retornados\" and music quickly became the source of inspiration to cope with this short lived social critique.  Iration managed to place the single  \"The Day After\" within the programming of most local radio stations and including as far away as Concepcion in the southern part of Chile. Reggae music was now introduced into the mainstream radio audiences and during this period of time Iration naturally began to compose in spanish.  This musical journey took them into an independent run into the Chilean underground cultural scene. Reggae music began to flourish and due to these circumstances in 1996 the \"Reggae Report\" magazine (USA) provided a pretty in depth look into the local reggae scene in Chile at that time (Vol. 14 # 3) and a brief review of the several emerging groups at that time and this brief summary on the talents of Iration:    \"Iration is a completely different story.  Three brothers: Mario (keyboards), Patricio (bass), and Gino Zamorano (drums) make up the most experienced band of the force, and perhaps the best as well.  They moved with their parents to Montserrat in 1973 as political exiles of the Pinochet government.  There they grew  up with Reggae and other Caribbean rhythms.  They then moved to New York in early 1990.  Iration has played on the college circuit in the U.S. and has recorded a single in Jamaica in 1993.  Moving to their beloved home country in late '94, they established themselves as the leading rhythm section in the country.  Now they are rehearsing material for their debut album to be recorded this summer\". Iration became the standard in the sense that they were performing with a full band including a brass section and backing vocals, something not seen asa yet in their country within this genre.  At that time being independent was viewed as an ultimate suicide but they took on this challenge, giving many interviews on radio, television (mostly culturally oriented program) exposing the mission of reggae music and even turned down a deal with the transnational conglomerate of Sony Music. Iration was performing what was considered as non commercial music and had no airplay, plus their was the fact of their strong lyrical content, so they worked extensively with community radios and performed at many schools for the youth. Looking at the positive side of their music these conditions ultimately gave them the freedom to speak their minds without any limitations and cemented a strong foundation for the upcoming reggae groups in Chile.  Iration began playing in most local clubs in Santiago such as the Rockola, La Ozz, Subte Discotheque, Caribbean and Boomerang just to name a few.  This was another challenge that was conquered within a reasonable amount of time by Iration even though reggae music was not even popular within this geographical area. It was years of hard work that made Iration a unique underground sensation, they eventually met the grand Dennis Stone a.k.a \"DreadStone\" who opened up Chile's first reggae and apparel store named \"Reggae Centro\" in which the youths were intimately exposed for the first time to a very broad variety of reggae music.   Dennis Stone has been involved in the REGGAE music biz for over 25 years, started back in the early 80's with his Dreadstone Sound System, NYC (selling his exclusive Dreadstone mixtapes out of VP Records as well as on the streets of manhattan).  He later formed BigUp Entertainment with partner Russell Javors in 1990 - managed, produced, promoted artists in Jamaica, US, South America, etc. Dennis has contributed to multiple Gold Record and Grammy nominated Reggae projects including the soundtrack for Disney's \"Cool Runnings\" film, also co-owned DownUnder Studios in S. Florida with producer Henry K, specializing in Reggae, Hiphop and R&B music. DREADSTONE is also the former manager for Tony Rebel (as well as executive producer for Rebel's acclaimed \"Vibes Of The Times\" album on Chaos/Columbia).  His production team delivered Diana King's demo and first U.S. release \"Stir It Up\" for Columbia/Sony and assisted in structuring the Stir It Up Tour and the Grammy nominated \"Stir It Up\" compilation, also for Columbia/Sony.  He has been associated with many fine artists such as Prezident Brown, Calton Coffie, Tony Curtis, Jigsy King, Professor Frisky, Nadine Sutherland, Garnet Silk, Uton Green, Ninja Man, Diana King, Bradley Brown, Rythmation, Iration, Gondwana, Roland Alphonso, Fiona, Delly Ranks, Deuteronomy, Natty Remo, Bigga Staar, Magano and many others.   DREADSTONE has worked alongside Sly Dunbar, Bobby Digital, Steven Stanley, Henry K, Donovan Germaine, Barry O'Hare, the Kelly Bros., Philip Smart, Courtney Cole, Clive Chin, Kirk Hedge and many other great Reggae Producers as well as Irie FM's popular Mighty Mike Jones.  He established \"Reggae Centro\" in Santiago, Chile in 1998 and promoted Reggae Thursdays at Boomerang in downtown Santiago, featuring Chile's premier reggae band \"Iration\".  Currently based in S. FL, producing and promoting talented reggae artists such as singer/songwriter/drummer Bradley Brown, as well as ongoing projects with established artists such as Carlton Coffie (the original JA Bad Boy), and upcoming singjay artist Adam \"Teacha\" Barnes.  Recording and mixing at Vybetribe Studio in S.FL as well as out of Barry O'Hare's World-A-Muzic Studio located in the historic Jack Ruby yard, Ocho Rios, JA with boomshot engineer/producer Kirk Hedge.  He is also currently collaborating with riddim-kings Heddrokk Productions in Miami.  Sourcing nuff dubplates from the JA young~maestro \"YelloKid\" himself (BIGUP YELLO!) and assisting House/Electro producer/DJ extraordinaire Austin Leeds with ongoing projects.  Continuing to forward great Reggae Music with a focus on Culture/Conscious Vibes.   Iration in 1997 soon followed to pursue the recording of their material and moved to New York City for 3 years. On their return to Chile they became the opening act for groups like Los Pericos, The Wailers, Lauryn Hill, Fabulosos Cadillacs, Auténticos Decadentes and Matisyahu. They were chosen as backing band for the performances of Kymani Marley and Andrew Tosh on their first visit to Chile. In September of 2003 Iration was invited by Isabel Allende to participate in the Tribute to Salvador Allende “El Sueño Existe” sharing the scene with artistes such as Silvio Rodriguez, Shalil Shankar, Vicente Feliú, Gerardo Alfonso, Los Prisioneros, Daniela Mercury, Julieta Venegas, Salvador Ojeda, León Gieco, Gilberto Gil, Daniel Viglietti, Congreso, Quilapayún, César Isella & Pedro Aznar. This was one of their best performances up to date and attendance at this tribute was around 80,000 +. Their message is clear and being an underground sensation definitely helped them stay in the cultural eyes of their people.   By late 2003 Warner Music Chile releases the album “Fusion de Estilos 2“ by the Hip-Hop group “Zaturno & Tapia Rabia” in which Iration composes and performs the first single “Cuando te veo pasar” of the album, the video clip aired on MTV Latino in late September and incorporated the talents of Quique Galdames of the group Illapu.  Iration by now had established themselves with enough exposure and basic financing to begin preparations to remix & upgrade addecuately their first album now titled “En Exilio / In Exile” and begin the task of making their first video clip for the song “Chile”, a classic example of their talent and quality of composition.  Iration’s album “En Exilio / In Exile” has musicians from the U.S.A., Cuba and Chile such as Rich Tozzoli, David Brian Ondrick (USA), Lino Borbolla, Jose Ismael Gomez (Cuba), Francisco Martinez, Ruben Salgado, Loretto Canales, Karen Vergara, Damian Bodenhofer, Fabian Cordova and Efrain Rodriguez (Chile) creating a nice blend of different styles within their music. It clearly has a Caribbean flavor with a slight South American touch and their music represents their conviction to spiritually fight for a better tomorrow, leaving clear that the most important value is to be part of the solution by just simply giving \"love\".   Iration programmed and performed at various venues during the summer of 2008 in the United States, which kicked off at the 1st Annual Budweiser Reggae Summerfest @ RFK Stadium in DC accompanying a line-up of artistes such as Iwayne, Kymani Marley, Turbulence, Beres Hamond, Etana, Chuck Fender and Ruth among others. It is from this platform that they embarked on promoting the worldwide release of their album \"En Exilio / In Exile\".  Also released was the single \"Amor Eres Tu\" - 2009 and \"Instrumental\" - Christmas/New Year 2010 which are all available online @ limewirestore, itunes, amazon, rhapsody, napster, emusic, lala, shockhound, imvu, nokia and amiestreet.com   Iration means creation in the patois dialect which is spoken in most of the Caribbean islands where english is the primary language.

    "headlinerBio": "There are multiple artists by the name of David Gray, including:\n1) a British singer-songwriter\n2) an Italian disco musician\n3) an American singer-songwriter\n4) drummer for the British blackened death metal band Akercocke\n5) a musician from South Africa\n\n1) David Gray  is a British singer-songwriter born on June 13, 1968 in Sale, United Kingdom. He released his first studio album in 1993 and received worldwide attention after the release of White Ladder six years later in 1999.\nGray moved to Wales at age 9 and later returned to the north-west of England to attend the University of Liverpool. His musical career got early support from a dedicated Irish fan base. After a few marginally-successful releases through the 1990s, Gray's breakthrough came with the worldwide release in 1999 of his fourth album, White Ladder; this was a critical and commercial success and included his best-known songs, \"This Years Love\" and \"Babylon\". In the United States, the album received a boost from jam-band leader Dave Matthews, who made it the first release by the record company he co-founded, ATO Records.\nOn August 11, 2001 White Ladder at last reached the top of the UK charts, having been selling steadily since its reissue the previous May, thereby setting a new record for the longest uninterrupted climb to No. 1. The follow-up, A New Day At Midnight, also hit No. 1, and Gray's seventh album, Life in Slow Motion was released on September 12, 2005.\nGray's early music was in a contemporary folk-rock, singer-songwriter mode; his primary instrument was acoustic guitar, with occasional piano. 1996's Sell Sell Sell featured some rock arrangements and electric instrumentation. Starting with the release of White Ladder in 1999, Gray began to make significant use of computer-generated music to accompany his voice and acoustic instrumentation, a technique which differentiates him from many of his peers. Despite the move to more complex music, Gray has used small-scale, often home-based, recording methods and equipment and espoused a \"do it yourself\" approach to music production. However, Life in Slow Motion is a collaboration with noted producer Marius De Vries.\nDavid Gray's brothers-in-law are Paul and Phillip Hartnoll, formerly of the Techno/Rave band Orbital. Because of this relationship, Gray performed guest vocals on the Orbital single Illuminate, while Paul Hartnoll produced a breakbeat remix of Gray's song \"Please Forgive Me\".\nHis successful single \"January Rain\" was included in the original soundtrack of the movie Serendipity, starring John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale.\nPictures and additional information can be found on his website, www.DavidGray.com.\n\n2) David Gray was an Italian disco musician who had a hit with \"Dead in the Water\"\n\n3) David Gray is an American singer-songwriter\n\n4) David Gray is drummer for the British blackened death metal band Akercocke\n\n5) David Gray is a musician from South Africa <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Gray\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The core members of Shpongle are Simon Posford and Raja Ram from the United Kingdom, along with many collaborators and guest musicians.  Ott is also credited on all albums.  Their sound is a mix of mainly eastern ethnic samples and western contemporary psychedelic synth music. Posford is responsible for the synth and studio work while Raja Ram contributes with flute arrangements. They are both responsible for the visionary input. According to one interview, they commonly visualize the music together before and during the creation process.  Shpongle's first tune, Vapour Rumours, was released on TIP Records' Infinite Excursions compilation in  1996. Their debut album, Are You Shpongled?, was released 1998 on Twisted Records. The high sound quality, successful mix of samples, instruments and synths along with the story and progress of the music through the album made it one of the most cutting edge releases of that time. Are You Shpongled? and Twisted Records' first downtempo compilation, Eclipse, made a huge impact on the psychedelic trance scene in 1998.  Simon Posford is also known for his solo productions as Hallucinogen and as driving force of the label Twisted Records UK. He is also part of Dub Trees (with Youth and Dubsahara), Celtic Cross (with Youth) and Younger Brother (with Prometheus).   Raja Ram is also a member of 1200 Micrograms (with GMS) and The Infinity Project (with Graham Wood, Anjee Sian and other contributors/collaborators). He was also founder of the indo-prog/raga rock group of the '60s/'70s Quintessence.  The bands lyrics and samples are often about the entheogen Dimethyltryptamine (DMT).  www.shpongle.com http://www.twistedmusic.com/artists/shpongle/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shpongle  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Shpongle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "NGHTMRE’s (aka Tyler Marenyi) rise to the top has been a dream to say the least. Some would say he arrived the day Skrillex made his ID the only unknown record in his 2015 Ultra set, a record that would go on to be arguably the biggest Trap song that summer. After playing his first headline gigs the week after, Tyler went on to hit almost every major festival in North America, including Lollapalooza, EDC Las Vegas, TomorrowWorld, Snow Globe, Freak Night, OMFG NYE, Moonrise, Contact Music Festival, and LifeInColor Festival. Only three months in as a touring DJ, he headlined six cities throughout Australia at legendary clubs such as Chinese Laundry and Ambar. After Australia, he went on to headline almost every major market in North America, hitting marquee venues such as Webster Hall, Avalon, The Mid, Beta, and Elektricity. He's known for his various Mad Decent smashes, including the trap song of the summer “Street” and his collaboration with Flosstradamus entitled “Lighters Up.” His Nuclear Bonds EP with long time friends, Slander, was one of the premiere EP releases from Diplo’s imprint.  From the writers online to the industry's top producers, it's ubiquitous: NGHTMRE is dance music’s next multi-genre prodigy. His tracks have charted #1 on Hype Machine multiple times and he was dubbed “Skrillex 2.0” by EarMilk.com. At the same time, he's gained support from the top dogs such as Skrillex, Diplo, Bassnectar, Flux Pavilion, Porter Robinson, RL Grime, Yellow Claw, Bro Safari, and Snails. In fact, the list of people he has been tapped to do official remixes for reads like a massive hipster festival: The Prodigy, Theophilus London, Keys N Krates, Flux Pavilion, The Griswalds, and Elliphant. If you want to hear something you’ve never heard before, make sure you always listen to Tyler’s most recent track, whatever it may be. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/NGHTMRE\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "I Prevail—Brian Burkheiser [clean vocals], Eric Vanlerberghe [harsh vocals], Steve Menoian [guitar], and Lee Runestad [drums]—explore this phenomenon within the title of their full-length debut, Lifelines [Fearless Records].  I Prevail are no strangers to this experience. After the release of the quartet’s 2014 debut EP, Heart vs. Mind, nothing would ever be the same. The EP moved over 60,000 copies as the Detroit band toured with the likes of Hollywood Undead and Crown The Empire. Meanwhile, the group’s cover of Taylor Swift’s “Blank Space” sold 300,000-plus singles, went Top 20 on Active Rock Radio, and generated over 22 million views on YouTube and 17 million-plus Spotify streams (consistently remaining in the Top 10 of the platform’s Viral Chart). The band would be nominated for “Breakthrough Band” at the 2016 Alternative Press Music Awards and garner features from Billboard, Detroit Free Press, AXS, Loudwire, and many more. Everything has aligned and set the stage perfectly their debut full-length, Lifelines.  In early 2016, the boys retreated to Wall of Sound Studios in the small and secluded town of Riley, Michigan to work with trusted producers B.J. Perry and John Pregler. With nearly two years on the road under their collective belt, the group had fully realized their style, merging entrancing hooks and a powerful and pummeling sonic backdrop. The first single “Scars” gallops from a propulsive riff into an unshakable refrain teetering between a hypnotic harmony and a hard-hitting groove. It’s immediately infectious. Elsewhere on the album “Stuck In Your Head” sees a magnetic vocal charge ahead in tandem with a bombastic drumbeat and hyper-charged guitars making the song live up to its name. Ultimately, Lifelines sees I Prevail take another big collective life step.  taken by: http://iprevailband.com/about <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/I+Prevail\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Origins In the spring of 2010 Schneider traveled from Los Angeles to Northern Michigan. At Lake Huron, he developed songs for the first Lord Huron EP. He named the recording, Into the Sun. Upon his return to L.A., Schneider set to work putting a band together. The first to join him was his percussion-playing childhood friend Mark. Each of the band members of band hail from Michigan.  Into The Sun and Mighty Lord Huron released two EPs in 2010, Into the Sun and Mighty. Pop & Hiss, the LA Times Music Blog, described Mighty as \"full of lush acoustic guitars and Midwestern-accented harmonies as warm as a winter fireplace, but it's the Caribbean-influenced percussion that fans Lord Huron's folk sound into flame,\"and Pitchfork could only classify it as \"a stylistic superball, bouncing off any wall you put around it.\" NPR's World Cafe wrote \"the band's lush harmonies are backed by a hazy whirlpool of polyrhythmic tropical drums and folk guitars.\" Despite the fact that Schneider played all of the instruments on both EPs, he has gathered a band for live performances, which have also gotten positive reviews. \"The totality of the experience was like being on hand for a combination drum circle, chamber performance, and Calypso street party,\" wrote LA Weekly.Some of the larger shows the band has performed at include Lollapalooza (2011) and Outside Lands (2011), as well as a marathon ten shows in four days at the SXSW (2011) music festival.

The group's members are guitarist Pete Bernhard, upright bassist Lucia Turino, and guitarist and tenor banjo player Cooper McBean.  “The rhythm is what our band is about.\" Says Pete Bernhard: Guitarist, Front Man. The Devil Makes Three are quite possibly the best band that you have never heard of. They have been constantly on tour, selling out dates across the country and in their neck of the woods on the West Coast drawing near capacity crowds nightly. This is all word of mouth. Over the years, the Devil Makes Three have garnered fans the old school way, playing a city, making friends, conquering fans and moving on.  Laced with elements of ragtime, blues, country, folk and rockabilly, the critically praised, drummer-less trio - consisting of Vermont native, guitarist/front man Pete Bernhard, stand-up bassist Lucia Turino and guitarist Cooper McBean, also of rural Vermont - brings forth a genuine approach to acoustic music.  The sound is deeply steeped in rhythm and alive with three part harmonies, while keeping a slightly punk aesthetic to their music and especially their live shows.

    "headlinerBio": "Celtic Woman is a musical group from Dublin, Ireland comprising five Irish women with a repertoire that ranges from traditional Celtic tunes to modern songs. Current members include the five vocalists  Méav Ní Mhaolchatha, Máiréad Carlin, Susan McFadden, Lynn Hilary, Alex Sharpe, and the violinist Máiréad Nesbitt. Deirdre Shannon sang with the group during Ní Mhaolchatha's pregnancy in 2005-2006. Hayley Westenra, a New Zealander of Irish descent, sang with the group during its 2006-2007 tour as its sixth member. Méav Ní Mhaolchatha and Órla Fallon were two of the original members of the group, though both have since left to pursue other projects.  In 2007, Ní Mhaolchatha left the group to focus on her solo career and was replaced by Hilary. Sharpe initially joined the group to fill in for Kelly who was on maternity leave, and later became a full member as a replacement for Fallon (who left to spend more time with family and record a solo work).  Since then, both Alex Sharpe and Lynn Hilary have left, making way for Lisa Lambe.  In 2013, Lisa Kelly left to pursue a teaching career at a Voice Academy she started up that year with her husband, making way for Susan McFadden for the 2013 Believe Tour.  In 2013, Chloë Agnew left to pursue solo work, making way for Máiréad Carlin.   Celtic Woman was recorded on September 15, 2004 for PBS Television in The United States at The Helix, Dublin to a sell-out audience. The show was organized by show producer Sharone Browne and musical director and composer David Downes, and produced by Dave Kavanagh. The show was first broadcast in March 2005 in The United States and within weeks the album Celtic Woman reached number one in the World Music charts in America and on Amazon.com charts. Their huge success in Asia and in America has been credited to the already successful megastar Enya and has been called \"Riverdance for the Voice\". As of July 22, 2006 the group has broken a long standing record in the music business. Their CD has been at the #1 position on the Billboard charts for an amazing 68 weeks.  On October 19th of that year, Celtic Woman was knocked off its No.1 spot on Billboard's World Music Charts, which it had maintained for 82 weeks, by Celtic Woman: A Christmas Celebration. This put the groups' 2 CDs at Nos. 1 and 2 respectively. Since then, Lisa Lambe has left the group to pursue a solo career. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Celtic+Woman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Béla Fleck (born July 10, 1958 in New York City, New York) is an American virtuoso banjo player. He is most well known for his work with the band Béla Fleck and the Flecktones, which he has described as \"a mixture of acoustic and electronic music with a lot of roots in folk and bluegrass as well as funk and jazz.\"  Fleck, who is named after famous Hungarian composer Béla Bartók, was drawn to the banjo when he first heard Earl Scruggs play the theme song for the television show Beverly Hillbillies. He received his first banjo at age fifteen from his grandfather (1973). Later, Fleck would enroll in New York City's High School of Music and Art where he studied French horn. Almost immediately after high school, Fleck traveled to Boston to play with Jack Tottle and Mark Schatz in Tasty Licks. It is with Tasty Licks that Fleck played on his first major album. During this period, Fleck released his first solo album (1979) \"Crossing the Tracks\". It was Fleck's first foray into progressive bluegrass composition.  Fleck would play on the streets of Boston with bassist Mark Schatz until the two formed Spectrum: the Band in 1981. Fleck toured with Spectrum until 1981. That year, Fleck was asked by Sam Bush and company to join New Grass Revival. Fleck performed with New Grass Revival for nine years. During this time, Fleck recorded another solo album, \"Drive.\" It was nominated for a Grammy Award in the then first-time category of Best Bluegrass Album (1988).  After a 1988 phone call with bassist Victor Wooten, Fleck and Wooten formed Béla Fleck and the Flecktones, rounded out with harmonica player Howard Levy and Wooten's percussionist brother Roy \"Future Man\" Wooten, who plays synthesizer-based percussion. Saxophonist Jeff Coffin joined the group with the album \"Left of Cool\".  With the Flecktones, Fleck has been nominated for and won several Grammy awards. Fleck has shared Grammy wins with Asleep at the Wheel, Alison Brown, and Edgar Meyer.

    "headlinerBio": "Chromeo is an electrofunk duo based in Montreal, Canada and New York City. They are P-Thugg (Patrick Gemayel) on keyboards, synthesizers and talk box, and Dave 1 (David Macklovitch) on guitar and lead vocals. The two were best friends since childhood and officially formed the band in 2002. They describe themselves as the only successful Arab/Jewish collaboration since the beginning of time.  David Macklovitch is currently earning his Ph.D in French literature from Columbia University, where he also teaches undergraduate French classes.  Highlights of their 2004 debut album She's In Control include club tracks Needy Girl, Mercury Tears, Rage!, and Destination: Overdrive. In 2005, Chromeo released a mix CD of funky dance tracks on Eskimo Belgium records entitled Un Joli Mix Pour Toi (A Pretty Mix For You). During early 2007 Chromeo supported indie rock group Bloc Party on their British tour.  Their second album \"Fancy Footwork\", produced by Chromeo themselves with the help of Tiga and mixed by Philippe Zdar from Cassius, was released on June 26th, 2007.  The album took them on a two-year world tour performing in festivals such as Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds in the UK, Fujirock in Japan, Iceland Airwaves in Iceland, Pemberton Music Festival in Canada and Coachella, Bonnaroo, Rothbury Festival and Lollapalooza in the US.  Chromeo contributed to K7's mixed series titled DJ-Kicks: Chromeo. In summer 2010 the track ' Fancy Footwork' was used as the sound track for a VO5 Extreme Hair Gel advertisement in the UK. The YouTube video of the original release in 2008 had over 666,000 hits by late July 2010.  Chromeo released their third studio album entitled \"Business Casual\" on September 14, 2010.  Their song \" Don't Turn The Lights On\" is featured on the video game FIFA 11 exposing them to a new group of listeners. In 2011 the same song was also featured on the video game Dirt3. Their song Bonified Lovin (Yuksek remix) is also on the video game FIFA 09.  At the beginning of March 2011, Chromeo sent out notice that it had recorded the \"world's smallest album,\" entitled Drive Time, which consists of 55 songs in only 183 seconds. About a week later, it was revealed that Drive Time is actually a free musical Nokia Own Voice satellite navigation pack for Ovi Maps, made for usage with Nokia's compatible cell phones. A red vinyl 5\" single consisting of regular, instrumental and a cappella versions of \"Turn Left\" and \"Follow\" was released to promote it, with a sticker on the shrink wrap saying that it was a numbered limited edition of 40 copies.  Trivia: Guitarist and lead singer David Macklovitch is the older brother of A-Trak (Alain Macklovitch), who in 1997 was the youngest-ever winner of the DMC World DJ Championship and is currently Kanye West's tour DJ.  Macklovitch is currently earning his Ph.D in French Literature from Columbia University.  http://www.myspace.com/chromeo <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chromeo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Widespread Panic is a rock band which formed in Athens, Georgia, United States in 1986. The band currently consists of John Bell (vocals, guitar), Jimmy Herirng (guitar), Dave Schools (bass), John \"JoJo\" Hermann (keyboards), Domingo \"Sunny\" Ortiz (percussion) and Todd Nance (drums). The band has previously included Michael Houser (guitar) and George McConnell (guitar) and have released 11 albums.  Michael Houser and John Bell ('JB') met at the University of Georgia at Athens between 1982 and 1984, and began playing music together around town as a duet. JB played solo shows as well. In the Fall of 1984, David Schools saw JB play a solo show at Abbots in Athens. Dave and JB were introduced by a mutual friend. Shortly thereafter, JB & Mike recruited Dave to play bass with them, and from Mike's nickname (\"Panic\"), the band name Widespread Panic was chosen. On February 24, 1985 the band played their first performance as Widespread Panic at the A-Frame house on Weymanda Court in Athens. Mike, JB, & Dave performed around Athens as a trio, occasionally utilizing local drummers. While their shows consisted primarily of cover tunes (by the likes of The Grateful Dead, Van Morrison, Bob Marley, and Traffic, among others), their repertoire did include a handful of original songs: Sleepy Monkey (the band's first original composition), Chilly Water, Space Wrangler, and Coconut (written by JB before joining the band). During this time, the trio also met vocalist Kelly Jo Davis (who is later married to blues guitarist and friend of WP, Tinsley Ellis). Kelly Jo performed frequently with the band throughout 1985 and 1986.  February 6, 1986, Mike recruited high school friend/band mate Todd Nance for a WP gig (an Aid For Africa benefit) at the Mad Hatter Ballroom in Athens, opening for Strawberry Flats (featuring John Keane). This is considered the first \"official\" Widespread Panic show. Todd evidently had a good time, and accepted their offer to join the band. On February 9, 1985, Mike, Dave, and JB, with Joel Morris on drums and Kelly Jo Davis on backing vocals, recorded Monkey Image (Sleepy Monkey) and Coconut Image (Coconut) at Panoramic Recording Studio in Arnoldsville GA, to be released as their first single. The 45rpm vinyl was released (in a pressing of only 500) shortly thereafter on the band's Space Baby label.  During the rest of 1986, WP played mainly in Athens, though they did branch out to venues in Macon, GA and South Carolina. Early on, they began playing every Monday night at the Uptown Lounge in Athens, a tradition that would last well into 1988. Along the way, they developed a solid batch of original tunes (in addition to the four originals that they played in 1985), including Stop-Go, C. Brown, Tie Your Shoes, Porch Song, Driving Song, Conrad, Vacation, Postcard, the instrumental Machine, and another instrumental jam that JB later adds lyrics to, titled Cardboard Box. On October 6, 1986, Texan percussionist Domingo S. Ortiz (\"Sunny\"), sat in with the band at the Uptown Lounge for the first time. Sunny continued to perform with the band on numerous occasions in Athens, Macon, and Atlanta, and eventually (late 1988 or early 1989) accepted the band's request for him to join as a full-time member.  During 1987, WP continued to play primarily in Georgia, while steadily spreading out to SC, NC, AL, TN, and as far north as Richmond, VA (Dave Schools' hometown). They developed a few more originals along the way, including Barstools & Dreamers, Contentment Blues, I'm Not Alone, and instrumentals L.a. (aka \"Liza's Apartment\"), and The Take Out. JB added lyrics to Cardboard Box, and to another instrumental titled \"Puppet Song\", subsequently renamed Pigeons. Cardboard Box was only played a handful of times before being dropped from the repertoire. In the Fall, the band signed with Landslide Records and recorded their first album, Space Wrangler, at John Keane's Studio in Athens. Guests on the album included Sunny on percussion, David Blackmon on fiddle, Tim White on keyboards, and Alberto Salazarte (of Athens band White Buffalo) on percussion.  In June of 1988, the first known guest appearance of producer John Keane on stage with the band occurred. Usually playing pedal steel, Keane became another regular guest at special Panic shows.  Their debut LP, Space Wrangler, established a small fan base and inaugurated several years of constant touring before the band signed to Capricorn Records and released their major label debut, Widespread Panic in 1991. After appearing with the H.O.R.D.E. tours for a few years, the band became one of the most popular new jam bands that arose in the mid-1990s. Their popularity peaked in the late 1990s/early 2000s, as their concert draw benefited from Phish's temporary hiatus. They still have a large draw in the South, where they are most popular.   Playing as many as 250 shows a year, Panic built a large fan base. True road warriors, Widespread Panic ranked among the top 50 grossing touring acts for eight years running, even without substantial radio airplay, television exposure, or promotion at retail stores. The band holds sellout records at Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver (23 shows), Oak Mountain Amphitheatre near Birmingham, Ala. (17 shows), Philips Arena in Atlanta (11 shows), and UNO Lakefront Arena in New Orleans (18 shows). Not to mention 20 sellouts at San Francisco's Warfield Theatre, seven sellouts across the Bay at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, nine sellouts at Mud Island in Memphis, seven at Memphis' Mid-South Coliseum, and in October 2003 for the popular Halloween shows sold out two concerts at New York's famed Madison Square Garden. To celebrate the release of their first live album, Light Fuse, Get Away, Widespread Panic offered a free \"CD release party\" concert in the streets of hometown Athens. An estimated 100,000 fans descended on the town, transforming it into the largest CD release party in history.  In August 2002, founding guitarist Michael Houser lost his battle with pancreatic cancer. George McConnell, a long time friend of the band and former Beanland,a Mississippi roots band, member joined in Houser's wake. After Hermann had joined Panic in 1992, McConnell often sat in whenever Panic played in the south. Friends for the past 15 years, Panic and McConnell had often played on the same bill for nearly as long. That longstanding relationship made him the natural choice to continue on with Panic after Michael Houser's death from pancreatic cancer in August of that year. \"It's all about chemistry,\" Schools said. \"We've been friends for 15 years.\" At the end of the summer tour, Panic went back to the studio to record Ball, a testament that, as Houser wished, they would continue as a band.  On August 2, 2006, the band announced that George McConnell would no longer be playing with the band. John Keane, friend and co-producer of many of the bands albums, provided guitar support for the remainder of the tour, along with Sam Holt. Both had been featured contributors in Widespread Panic concerts since the beginning of the Summer 2006 tour. The following day, the band announced that guitarist Jimmy Herring, who had previously been a member of the 1990s band the Aquarium Rescue Unit and had toured with The Allman Brothers Band and members of The Grateful Dead, would join the band, beginning with the first show of the Fall 2006 tour at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York.  The band has sold over 3 million albums, and released a total of 15 CDs and five DVDs (including Live at Oak Mountain, which is certified Gold).   In June 2006, their 9th and most recent studio album, Earth to America, was released. Earth to America was recorded with Terry Manning in Nassau, Bahamas at the beautiful Compass Point Studios.   In late 2006, Fayetteville, NC native Jimmy Herring took over the reins of the lead guitarist in the band, kicking off their fall tour with three nights at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York.  Panic’s 7th annual New Year’s shows on December 30 and 31 of 2007, marked their 15th and 16th sellout performance at Philips Arena.  The band released their 10th album, Free Somehow, on February 12, 2008. It, too, was recorded with producer Terry Manning at Compass Point Studios.  Following the release of the new studio album, Widespread Panic began to release vintage concert performances from the Widespread Panic Archives. Carbondale 2000 was released on June 10, 2008, followed by Valdosta 1989 released on February 24, 2009, and Huntsville 1996 released on June 23, 2009. The band will continue to dig into their show archives, which encompasses the past 25 years, and release these shows as multi-track recordings.  June 27, 2008, marked the band's 32nd sold-out show at Red Rocks Amphitheater. This was more than any other band in the venue's history. Mayor John Hickenlooper proclaimed Friday, June 27 \"Widespread Panic Day\" in the City and County of Denver. The same year, Widespread Panic was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame on September 20.  The band continued to tour throughout the rest of 2008 and the spring of 2009. In the summer of 2009, Widespread Panic teamed up with fellow southern rockers, The Allman Brothers to do a summer and fall co-headlining tour.  In March 2010, it was announced that Widespread Panic would be releasing a new album entitled Dirty Side Down on May 25, 2010. The band is also releasing Live in the Classic City II, containing music from its 2000 shows.  On September 29, 2010, Widespread keyboardist Jojo Herman announced that the band would be going on hiatus in 2012. In an interview with the Vanderbilt Hustler, Herman explained, \"Next year will be our 25th anniversary. After that, we're probably going to call it (quits) for awhile. So we're looking forward to next year and going out on a high note.\"    <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Widespread+Panic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Five Finger Death Punch were formed in 2005 by guitarist Zoltan Bathory (formerly of U.P.O.). The American Capitalist Songfacts states that Bathory came up with the name after being amused by a scene involving a five finger punch in Kill Bill 2.  Other members recruited to the band include former Motograter & Ghost Machine vocalist Ivan Moody, former W.A.S.P. members guitarist Darrell Roberts and drummer Jeremy Spencer, and former Anubis Rising/Deadsett bassist Matt Snell.\n\nThe band recorded their debut album The Way of the Fist in 2006 with Stevo \"Shotgun\" Bruno (Mötley Crüe, Prong) and Mike Sarkisyan (Spineshank). The record was mixed and mastered by former Machine Head/Soulfly guitarist Logan Mader.\nAfter making waves in the underground metal scene, in early June it was announced that the band had inked a deal with Firm Music, which is a branch of \"The Firm\", a highly successful management company (Korn, Staind, Limp Bizkit). Their debut album \"The Way Of The Fist\" was released on July 31, 2007 The record broke into the Billboard 200 on its first week of release, and hit the #1 position on Billboard's New Artist/Heetseekers chart. Their First single, \"The Bleeding\" landed in the top 40 rock radio charts, eventually worked its way into the top 10 and ruled the radio waves for an astonishing 8 months. In times when US Rock Radio is anything but friendly toward heavier bands, against all odds 5FDP not just repeated but surpassed their first single's success with their follow up \"Never Enough\". The song climbed even faster to set up a seemingly permanent camp in the top 10, until the 3rd single \"Stranger Than Fiction\" showed up on the horizon to take over the guard post.\nSupporting their release, for 19 consecutive months Five Finger Death Punch has relentlessly toured North America, eventually establishing themselves as a true headlining act and selling almost 300,000 records in the USA before branching out to the rest of the world. The international release of \"The Way Of The Fist\" (via Spinefarm/Universal) is scheduled to hit stores across the world in January 2009.\nIn 2009, guitarist Darrel Roberts was replaced by Jason Hook (Bullet Boys, Alice Cooper). In 2011, Chris Kael (12v Negative Earth, Hymen, Hecatomb, Cut.Love.Kill) became the bassist for 5FDP. Chris Kael won the Revolver Golden Gods award for best bassist in 2014.\n\n\nLos Angeles, California\n2005  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Five+Finger+Death+Punch\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The Infamous Stringdusters is an American acoustic/bluegrass band. The band emerged in 2007 with the album Fork in the Road on Sugar Hill Records. The band's current line-up features Andy Hall (Dobro), Andy Falco (guitar), Chris Pandolfi (banjo), Jeremy Garrett (fiddle), and Travis Book (double bass).\n\nDismiss labels, forget trying to fit into a scene, be true and play your songs; that encompasses the prevailing spirit of Let It Go, the fifth studio album from Grammy-nominated bluegrass expansionists The Infamous Stringdusters. The album, released on the band’s own High Country Recordings, finds the band on firm footing, at ease with an evolving sound that defies categorization. It’s acoustic music, sure, but not the kind you’ll hear from any other band. Roots can be traced but boundaries don’t exist.  \n \nThe Infamous Stringdusters have proven they can both mine the past and look forward to the unknown, and their new album is a touchstone for a group of tightly bonded musicians completely comfortable with each other and their collective identity.\n \nPerhaps the sentiment is best summarized through five joined voices in the mountaintop gospel-hued title track: “If it’s worry you’ve been feeling over things you can’t control, it’s time to let it go.”\n \nThe Evolution\n \nWhen The Infamous Stringdusters first emerged some years ago, the band was immediately branded fast-picking Nashville wunderkinds, a new-generation super group built to revive the high lonesome sound. Then came immediate accolades—IBMA awards, a chart-topping self-titled album for Sugar Hill Records and a Grammy nomination for “Best Country Instrumental” (for \"Magic No. 9\" from the 2010 album Things That Fly). Incendiary chops, complete with undeniable instrumental virtuosity and heartfelt harmonies, immediately positioned the band to be longstanding bluegrass torchbearers.\n \nBut for the five members of The Stringdusters—Andy Hall (Dobro), Andy Falco (guitar), Chris Pandolfi (banjo), Jeremy Garrett (fiddle) and Travis Book (upright bass)—reverence for traditionalism has always been only part of the equation. The group has always remained intent on fostering something bigger, more original. It’s this desire—and the combined efforts of uniquely creative minds—that has brought the quintet to its current place as multi-dimensional string explorers, mixing tight song craft from a variety of musical styles with a flare for improvisation. Armed with an exhilarating, often-unpredictable live show, the open-minded approach has certainly resonated and allowed the band to easily fit on a diverse set of stages—from Telluride and Grey Fox to Bonnaroo and High Sierra—building crowds along the way that fill some of the country's best rock clubs.\n \nThe Lifestyle Experience\n \n2014 was particularly transformative, as the band members realized there was no need to go through the formulaic motions in a shaky music industry. Bolstered by the support of a loyal and dedicated grassroots fan base, The Infamous Stringdusters are constantly looking for opportunities to create new experiences. Oftentimes it happens on stage, like the recent sit-ins from Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh or jazz guitar legend John Scofield. Other times it’s through accompanying adventures, like the band’s August 2013 trip on the Middle Fork of Idaho’s Salmon River.\n \nFollowing the group’s 2013 summer American Rivers Tour, which doubled as an awareness campaign for water sustainability issues in partnership with prominent outdoor industry companies including Patagonia, Klean Kanteen and Osprey Packs, the band members and select fans and friends embarked on a six-day float trip through an unspoiled wilderness area. With instruments in tow, the band played music daily, standing on the banks of the river or sitting together in campsite circles. The inspiration of natural surroundings yielded fresh songs that landed on the new album. “Middlefork” is a newgrass instrumental that conveys the mood of being free in pristine open spaces. “Where The Rivers Run Cold” features a fast progression and introspective lyrics that peak with a bold chorus about enjoying the beauty that surrounds.\n \nIn The Studio\n \nWhen it was time to record Let It Go, the band came together in the fall at White Star Sound, a secluded studio with rustic, close-knit accommodations and state-of-the-art equipment, located on a vast, historic farm outside of Charlottesville, Virginia. It’s a quiet place, accessed by a dirt road, where chickens wander freely and long pastoral views can be enjoyed in every direction. With no distractions, it was the perfect place to distill an overflowing well of ideas that had been filling since the band’s last release, 2012’s Silver Sky.\n \nThe result is easily the band’s most cohesive musical statement to date. It’s a record that respects the studio process. Dynamic picking is delivered with restrained grace, in service to song. There’s stylistic range within the context of a unified vision, as melodic reflective tunes wander between nuanced expansive folk (“I’ll Get Away”), anthemic country jams (“Colorado”), freewheelin’ acoustic rock (“Peace of Mind” and “Light & Love”) and dusty balladry (“Rainbows”).\n \nThe members of The Infamous Stringdusters now all reside in different locations. Hall and Pandolfi recently felt the calling of the mountains and both moved to Colorado. Guitar ace Falco returned to his roots in Long Island to be near family, while Garrett remains in Nashville, where he’s known as a prolific songwriter. Book dwells quietly in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, near the site of the band’s annual October festival The Festy Experience.\n \nOccasional separation has proven to be a good thing. It’s important to remember these are five musicians with unique individual talents, but they all realize they have an undeniably special chemistry when they come together. That was apparent from day one. But now after years of growth—both personal and professional—the band has cast off labels and found an existence where music is about a greater connection. Through friendship, democracy, skill, passion and open minds, it’s a broader lifestyle filled with community and plenty of celebration.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Infamous+Stringdusters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Randy Rogers Band is an American \"Texas Country\" group from the state of Texas that formed in 2000. The band is composed of Randy Rogers (lead vocals), Geoffrey Hill (guitar), Jon Richardson (bass guitar), Brady Black (fiddle), and Les Lawless (drums).\n\nWhen the Randy Rogers Band’s last project debuted as the most-downloaded country album on iTunes, plenty of the industry “insiders” on Music Row were left scratching their heads: Who are these guys? \n\nThe Nashville elite may not have known about the five-piece band, but much of America already did. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them alongside such artists as U2 and the Stones in its list of Top 10 Must-See Artists in the summer of 2007. They earned $2.5 million—a staggering total for a still-developing act—on the tour circuit in a single year. Willie Nelson, the Eagles, Gary Allan and Dierks Bentley all picked them as opening acts for their concerts. And more than 2,200 people showed up and bought the bands album at an appearance at Wherehouse Music. \n\nThe fans’ exuberance was shared by USA Today, which praised the band for having “loads of grit, swagger and heart.” \n\nThe Randy Rogers Band built its audience by combining forces: It’s a dynamic live act centered around songs that fit the rowdy, party vibe of the concert circuit, but their songs also say something. \n\nThat’s particularly true in their album, The Randy Rogers Band, in which a dozen persuasive tracks give the listener plenty of reasons to want to down a celebratory brewski. But the songs also maintain a depth that makes them powerful and provocative even beyond their edgy arrangements and tough-guy sound. \n\nInvariably, the songs are about people making choices and dealing with the consequences they bring. That’s the case in the opening “Wicked Ways,” in which a string of wild endeavors leaves an out-of-control adult in need of redemption. It’s true in “When The Circus Leaves Town,” where a performer comes to terms with the emotional crash that accompanies the conclusion of a pumped-up show. It’s even a tenet in “One Woman,” a ballad that finds a former playboy recognizing his old choices and behaviors were a shallow pursuit next to the promise and solidity that stand before him. \n\n“These songs are definitely true, and they’re relatable to many different life situations that I’ve either gone through in the past or will go through in the future,” Rogers, the lead singer and primary songwriter, says. “I just tried to create believable characters and relatable characters. I hear from fans that we really have helped them in real-life situations when they’ve applied the songs to their everyday life. That’s what I strive for in the songs that I write.” \n\n“We’re not old, but we are getting a little bit more mature,” bass player Jon Richardson asserts, drawing laughter from the rest of the band. “We’re trying to be more mature, anyway. And that’s something that we can write about a little more naturally now instead of ‘Here’s a song about how much fun I had’ or ‘Here’s a song about a girl.’ That’s probably just a natural progression of our own lives being reflected in our songs.” \n        \nIndeed, the Randy Rogers Band is confronting the same questions about relationships and identity that face many of the college students and young adults that form the centerpiece of the group’s audience. The balancing act between work, home and recreation is a difficult one—even tougher for an ensemble that spends more than 200 days annually on the road. \n\n        “All the guys, except for Jon, are married or soon to be married,” guitarist Geoffrey Hill observes. “Les [drummer] and I both have kids. So sometimes it feels like you’ve really gotta struggle to fit all that into your life, I guess, but it’s kinda part of the game. I always said that I play music for free, and I get paid to leave the family behind and go on the road.” \n\n        That requires a constant rededication to the group, a commitment the five members have repeatedly made since the current lineup coalesced in 2003. \n\n        The Randy Rogers Band’s status as a group has occasionally confused its audience, which sometimes assumes Rogers is simply a solo artist. It’s the same issue that acts such as Huey Lewis & The News and Edwin McCain have battled, though one that doesn’t concern RRB all that much. \n\n        “I don’t think it’s an issue at all,” fiddler Brady Black asserts. “I think when we got together, Randy had already had a band, and his name had been out a little bit, and so we just kind of went with it.” \n\n        “That,” Black smirks, “and he owned the van…” \n\n        Actually, the name came rather innocently. Rogers had developed a following, he played open-mic nights, impressing club owner Kent Finlay enough to offer Rogers his own regular night, as long as he found a band to back him. \n\n        That group might have taken his name, but Rogers—who’d had previous experiences as a guitar player in another band—had no interest in being just a one-man show. \n\n        “I always wanted everybody to be equal, not only financially but also input-wise and creatively,” he says. “When we started the band, I pledged to them that I would work every day as hard as I could and try to get us down the highway a little further if they would sign up with me and share in some of those sacrifices, and I think from that day on, everybody pretty much quit their alternative jobs, and kinda gave 110 percent to the band.” \n\n        The Randy Rogers Band took the same slot that George Strait and the Ace In The Hole band had once occupied at Cheatham Street, appropriate since the band used the same sort of inner motivation in building its sound as Strait did a generation ago. \n\n        Their music is hardly the same. In contrast to Strait’s pure-country aesthetics, RRB combines that traditional country sound with a rollicking, swagger influenced by rugged sounds from such diverse sources as Waylon Jennings and Stone Temple Pilots. But, as Finlay recognized, there’s an authenticity and honesty to the band that parallels Strait’s personal manifesto. \n\n        “In a way, George was a little bit out of the box for Nashville when he debuted,” Rogers notes, “I think George Strait, when he first hit town, he knew who he was, and I think that’s partly why he has been so successful throughout his career. If there’s a correlation between the two of us, I think that we definitely have a sound and we know who we are.” \n\n        The Randy Rogers Band further distinguishes that identity in its self-titled album, the band’s second release since signing with Mercury Nashville. Produced by longtime admirer Radney Foster, who’s successfully maintained alt country integrity while writing mainstream hits for the likes of Sara Evans and Keith Urban, sessions for The Randy Rogers Band took place at Dockside Studios, a bayou location in Maurice, Louisiana, that’s also been the breeding ground for projects by B.B. King, Mavis Staples, Keb’ Mo’, Levon Helm and Mark Knopfler. \n\n        “We shut ourselves up for 10 days and had a band-camp set up,” Richardson observes. “There weren’t any distractions. It wasn’t like we were all goin’ home every night and comin’ back the next day. We were just living and breathing it for 10 days or so. We were just completely absorbed by it.” \n\n        The consequences of that choice are just as absorbing for the listener. The album ranges from the hypnotic country of “Buy Myself A Chance” and the first single, “In My Arms Instead,” to the propulsive buzz of “Never Be That High” to the painful conclusion, “This Is Goodbye.” \n\n        Rogers’ various performances reflect the wide-ranging influences that snapped together in the process, evoking at times the sneer of Steve Earle, the soul of Bakersfield’s Monty Byrom (formerly of Big House) and the vulnerability of Keith Urban. \n\n        With its infectious hooks and daring attitude, the album underscores the iTunes popularity of the Randy Rogers Band, its critical appeal and its significance on the nation’s concert circuit, where they’ve broken attendance records at numerous clubs across the heartland. Even Kenny Chesney, who consistently places among the top-selling tours, saw the group’s blue-collar connection when he covered Rogers’ “Somebody Take Me Home” for the album The Road And The Radio. \n\n        Each of the five members recognizes his contribution to the Randy Rogers Band’s overall unity, and they repeatedly make choices—creatively and personally—that keep that all-for-one-and-one-for-all solidarity intact.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Randy+Rogers+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "There are two bands that go by the name of Fruition.\n\n1. Fruition (Portland, OR) has been showcasing their captivating brand of Folk, Soul, Grass and Rock 'n Roll to the West Coast since 2008.  In the last few years they have expanded to the greater US scene, playing theaters, bars, street corners and Music Festivals all over the country (SXSW, High Sierra Music Fest, Yarmony Grass, String Summit, Oregon Country Fair, Omaha Summerfest and many more.)\n\nThis year they're hitting it even harder - they opened for Railroad Earth at the Crystal Ballroom (Portland, OR) for NYE, and are venturing out on a several-month tour that will hit all corners of the USA.  They've shared stages with a range of popular bands- ALO, Greensky Bluegrass, Yonder Mountain Stringband, Scott Law, Everclear, Railroad Earth, Furthur, Carolina Chocolate Drops, Leftover Salmon, Elephant Revival, Hot Buttered Rum, Delhi 2 Dublin, Infamous Stringdusters, Great American Taxi, Danny Barnes, Head for the Hills, and many many more.\nIn June of 2013, they will be putting out a new full-length album that will surely thrust them from opening-slots and small stages to headlining gigs and large capacity venues.  \n\nwww.FruitionBand.com\nwww.facebook.com/fruitionpdx\n\n2.

    "headlinerBio": "\"Madeon is a french electronic musician who talks about himself in the third person - what a snob.\" ~ Hugo Leclercq (Madeon)\n\nHugo Leclercq (born May 30, 1994), known by his stage name Madeon, is a self-described \"electro-pop-house-whatever\" producer from Nantes, France. \n\nLeclercq started composing music at the age of 11, and adopted a nu-disco style under the name \"Madeon\" in 2010. In the fall of that year, at the age of just 16, he gained popularity for his award-winning remix of The Island by Pendulum which was praised by the likes of Skrillex and Pendulum front-man Rob Swire.\n\nIn 2011, he created a remix for Yelle's \"Que veux-tu\", and then went on to remix deadmau5's Raise Your Weapon which was praised by deadmau5 himself on Facebook and other social utilities. In the summer of 2011, a \nYouTube video of his live mashup \"Pop Culture\" went viral, which combines 39 pop hits into one song. As of November 2012, it has approximately fifteen million hits.\n\nLeclercq has been featured on 15 Minutes of Fame, a segment of Pete Tong's radio show on BBC Radio 1. Also on the 27th of January 2012 he played a 20 minute set as part of a show organised by Pete Tong to showcase up and coming stars in Electronic music. He included some of his own songs such as Pop Culture and Icarus, as well as merging songs together; These ranged from Shuriken alongside Que Veux Tu and DJ, to M83's Midnight City being played on top of a Madeon edit of Blitz by Digitalism.\n\nLeclercq has cited The Beatles and Daft Punk as his greatest musical influences. He is also known to use Novation's Launchpad for his live performances, and FL Studio as his music production program of choice. \n\nA debut EP was scheduled to be released in 2012, but then cancelled in favour of multiple singles, the first of which – Icarus – is planned to be released in February 2012.\n\nMid 2012 Madeon teamed up with one of EDM’s favorite voices, Ellie Goulding, to produce Stay Awake. The track was meant for Ellie’s Halcyon album, but wasn’t delivered in time. It made a standalone release in March 2013.\n\nIt wasn't until 2015 that Madeon's debut album, Adventure, was released by Columbia. The album reached number one on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums chart and featured hit singles such as Pay No Mind and Nonsense. Alongside the album's release were two headlining tours.\n\n2016 gave way to a collaboration with artist Porter Robinson to create the animated single Shelter. The song has gained over thirty-five million views as of September 2018 and was played live alongside many others of the artist's previous tracks during the Shelter Live tour.\n\nSocial Media Links:\nFacebook - www.facebook.com/itsmadeon\nTwitter - www.twitter.com/madeon\nSoundcloud - www.soundcloud.com/madeon\nYoutube - www.youtube.com/user/itsmadeon <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Madeon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Michael Franti (born April 21, 1967 in Oakland, CA) is a gifted and much-heralded spoken word artist and political activist from San Francisco, CA. As leader of the politically and socially-charged group Spearhead, Franti is at the forefront of hip-hop's renaissance, expanding the music's boundaries as he draws on funk and soul-driven beats. Through his music and poetry, Franti tackles a range of issues--the criminal justice system, corporatization of our daily lives, AIDS, gay rights, homelessness, the death penalty, drug addiction and suicide.  His project Spearhead produced the critically acclaimed Home in 1994. The album contained his biggest single, \"Hole in the Bucket,\" a thoughtful lament on the plight of the homeless, and \"Positive,\" which addressed the growing AIDS epidemic. The album boasted adept funk samplings, sinuous guitar vamps, and soulful, melodic tracks about family and social injustice. 1997's Chocolate Supa Highway was not as pop-friendly as Home, but neither did its themes of kidnappings and police brutality lend themselves to such overt accessibility. Its mixture of harsher musical styles -- techno, rock, and funk -- was a step forward for Franti as his world view broadened and deepened. In 2001, Franti released Stay Human. In it he expresses his anger at the system, his advocacy of love, and his belief in freedom through individuality and self-expression through a set of songs that revolve around a fictitious death penalty case. In it, his embrace of the genres that inspired him is achieved with eloquence.   Earlier projects of Franti include The Beatnigs and The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, which had more of an experimental/industrial sound, but addressed many of the same social/political issues.  As a celebration of the Election of Barack Obama Franti recorded the Obama Song, offered as a free track on downloaded at their offical website, www.michaelfranti.com/.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Franti+&+Spearhead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Big Head Todd & the Monsters is a rock band formed in 1986 in Colorado. The band has released eight studio albums since 1989 with their 1993 album Sister Sweetly going well beyond platinum in the US. The band has developed a sizeable live following especially in the Mountain States of the US.   Big Head Todd and The Monsters – singer-guitarist Todd Park Mohr, bassist-singer Rob Squires, drummer-singer Brian Nevin and keyboardist-guitarist-singer Jeremy Lawton --  could have begun resting on their laurels back in 1993, when their Top 10 singles “Bittersweet,” “Broken Hearted Savior,” “Circle” and “It’s Alright” pushed the album Sister Sweetly to platinum certification. However, Mohr says, “I’ve fought throughout our career not to be a one-trick pony, to be the kind of band that has depth and diversity in its catalogue. I’m a fan of this band, and I’m constantly looking forward to what comes next.” The essence of Big Head Todd and The Monsters – a rootsy, emotionally direct variety of rock ’n’ roll that lends itself particularly well to a live setting – has been winning fans since Mohr, Rob Squires and Brian Nevin started playing together in high school (Jeremy Lawton joined in 2004). Needless to say, the three never expected to be in the same band at this late date, but, as Mohr points out, “It was a really fortunate combination of musical personalities, and we’re still partners in every sense of the word.” The band spent seven years developing their chemistry and amassing a following, boosted significantly by the independent releases Another Mayberry (1989) and Midnight Radio (1990), before being “discovered” by the listening public at large with 1993’s Sister Sweetly. After a major-label stint (Sister Sweetly, 1994’s Stratagem, 1997’s Beautiful World), during which the trio increasingly found itself frustrated artistically, they reclaimed their independent status (2001’s Riviera, 2004’s Crimes of Passion). “If it were not for our ability to do things for ourselves, we would have disappeared a long time ago,” Mohr allows.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Head+Todd+and+the+Monsters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Dispatch is an American indie-roots band founded in 1996 in Middlebury, Vermont.  The band originated in the early 1990s as One Fell Swoop, but changed their name to Dispatch in 1996. Chad Urmston, Braddigan, and Pete (Francis) Heimbold, who were all attending Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont comprised the band's lineup throughout their entire career. Their music has drawn on several influences, such as acoustic folk-rock, reggae, and funk.  Dispatch gained much recognition outside of New England, without any help from a label, and stuck together long enough to release seven albums, three of which were live performances. During concerts, the band had been known to improvise upon their album releases, often resulting in a song ending in twice the length of the original. The group was also fond of switching instruments and vocal duties when playing live.  Upon the announcement of its break-up in 2002, the band scheduled one final concert. The free show was performed at the Hatch Shell in Boston on July 31, 2004. \"The Last Dispatch,\" as it was referred, is said to be the largest concert in independent music history; roughly 110,000 fans from over 20 different countries attended the show. Parts of the performance were released as a CD/DVD two-disc set later that year, entitled All Points Bulletin, along with an earlier show in Somerville, Massachusetts.  All three of the band's members are currently still in the music industry. Urmston is now the frontman of State Radio, while Corrigan (now credited as Braddigan, a nickname by which he was known since his time with Dispatch) and Heimbold (now credited as Pete Francis, his middle name) are succesfully pursuing solo efforts.  After the song Elias, written by Urmston after his experience living and teaching in Zimbabwe, the \"Elias Fund\" was formed to send children from the ravaged country to college.  Dispatch came out with a movie entitled \"Last Dispatch\" in July 2005, which documents their final 12 days together as a band and tells the story of how they became \"the band that redefined independent music history\". The film was released and previewed in Boston. Chad, Brad, and Pete attended the showing and celebrated throughout the weekend with their fans.  On December 22, 2005, Corrigan helped to organize a benefit concert, known as the Relief Project, at Irving Plaza in New York, New York. Along with several other performers, Corrigan invited Heimbold and State Radio to play. The three reunited very briefly, playing the song Here We Go as an encore. Corrigan stated there that he plans further Relief Project concerts featuring all three and perhaps sometime in 2007, a major Dispatch reunion concert.   Entitled \"Dispatch: Zimbabwe\", Dispatch arranged for one show in Madison Square Garden, with all the money sent towards relief efforts in Zimbabwe.  Originally billed as a one show deal on July 14, Dispatch was surprised how quickly this first show sold out and set two more shows for the 13 and 15. After all three shows sold out, Dispatch announced another smaller show on July 11th at Webster Hall in  New York, where they made their comeback debut to great success.    Dispatch had a second set of reunion concerts beginning at Red Rocks amphitheater in Denver, Colorado on June 3, 4, and 5th,  2011. These performances launched a reunion tour around the US and the release of their Dispatch EP on May 17th.  In 2017, the band released the song, \"Only The Wild Ones\" from their album, America, Location 12. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dispatch\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Umphrey's McGee is a progressive rock / jam band from South Bend, IN now based in Chicago, IL.  They are influenced musically by progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Dream Theater, and Genesis, as well as heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden. The band also identifies The Police, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences. However, there really isn't a style of popular music that Umphrey's does not cover. Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to Paul Simon.  Formed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands.   In mid-1998, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as Divisions and All in Time.  Shortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.  The addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar). Another live album, One Fat Sucka, was released shortly after, containing live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.  Around 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the \"Jimmy Stewart Ballroom\" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions \"Jimmy Stewart.\" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by \"McL\" in the \"Jimmy Stewart writeup\" on the fan message board known as \"The Bort\" at www.umphreaks.com.  2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, Umphrey's was invited to play the first annual Bonnaroo Music Festival which took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date and ended up selling more CDs than any other artist on the bill including Widespread Panic, Trey Anastasio, and Norah Jones.  In October 2002 drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving to attend medical school. After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.    In 2004, the band released the critically-acclaimed album Anchor Drops, recorded in several different studios throughout the Chicago area. Shortly before the release of the album, the band scored a distribution deal for both Anchor Drops and Local Band Does OK, and for the first time, Umphrey's music was available in stores all over the country. Anchor Drops received rave reviews from several high-profile magazines. Umphrey's was booked to play the Bonnaroo Music Festival once again in June but unlike their 2002 performance, this time they would play a coveted late-night spot. The band performed to over 20,000 people, many of whom had never heard the band before. Shortly after in July, Umphrey's was declared by Rolling Stone Magazine to \"have become odds-on favorites in the next-Phish sweepstakes.\"   In April 2006, Umphrey's released their fourth studio effort, Safety in Numbers. They appeared on the late night TV program Jimmy Kimmel Live in May and were featured at many of the major U.S. festivals throughout the summer, playing 129 shows before a three-night stand in Chicago for New Year's Eve. The Bottom Half, an album of leftover tracks from the Safety in Numbers sessions, was released a year later in April, 2007. It was supported with tours of the U.S., Europe, and Japan.    A live double-album titled Live at the Murat was released in October, 2007. The album was recorded over 2 nights at the Egyptian Room in the Murat Centre in Indianapolis, Indiana on April 6-7, 2007. It received a 4-star review from Rolling Stone Magazine. The album also won a Jammy for best live album. Another live double album release came in June 2008, when the band put out Jimmy Stewart 2007. The album consisted entirely of live, improvised \"Jimmy Stewart\" sessions recorded in 2007.  Umphrey's McGee completed work on their next studio album, Mantis, in late 2008. Recorded mainly in Manny Sanchez’s I.V. Lab Studios in Chicago, the band members began by presenting each other with CDs containing hundreds of musical ideas they’d composed over the past dozen years, which were then shifted and trimmed down to the concise tracks that appear on the album. The band’s longtime sound caresser, Kevin Browning, edited and mixed the album's material.   Mantis became available for pre-order on October 27, 2008. Along with the pre-order announcement came information that unique bonus content would be available and more content would unlock depending on how many pre-orders were placed. This unusual method of distribution has been hailed as the \"perfect way to implement a pre-order campaign\" by Reuters.com.  Mantis was released on January 20, 2009. The album marked Umphrey’s second decade together as a band and was the first Umphrey’s album to consist entirely of material never previously performed on the road. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Umphrey%27s+McGee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Sublime with Rome is a collaboration between Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh of Sublime and Rome Ramirez. Vocalist and guitarist Rome Ramirez joined Wilson and Gaugh to perform classic material and eventually originals. It became clear that Ramirez could not replace Sublime's late lead singer and guitarist, Bradley Nowell, who died in 1996 but legally, he would simply be \"featured with\" former Sublime members.   Sublime with Rome performed their first gig together in February 2009 near Gaugh's home in Nevada, followed by an appearance at Cypress Hill's Smokeout Festival in San Bernadino that October. On April 20, 2010, the band embarked on their first-ever US tour with dates going into that fall. After positive reaction on the road, Sublime with Rome released a debut album on Fueled By Ramen records in July 2011.   In December 2011, Bud Gaugh revealed in an interview that he would be leaving Sublime With Rome and KROQ's Accoustic Christmas would be his last show. He saying he wanted to go home and spend more time with his family.  He later went on to say  \"It was really good for the first few months, after that, it just felt wrong. Not playing the songs but playing them with the name Sublime, without Brad.\" When asked if he saw the band reuniting in the future Gaugh replied \"No, I am done with SWR. I would be into playing music with Eric Wilson, however.\" He was replaced by Josh Freese. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sublime+with+Rome\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Eric Whitacre (born 2 January 1970 in Reno, NV) is an American composer of choral, wind band and electronic music. He has also served as a guest conductor for ensembles throughout Europe, Asia, Australia and the Americas.\n\nAn accomplished composer, conductor and lecturer, Eric Whitacre has quickly become one of the most popular and performed composers of his generation. The Los Angeles Times has praised his compositions as \"works of unearthly beauty and imagination, (with) electric, chilling harmonies\"; while the BBC raves that \"what hits you straight between the eyes is the honesty, optimism and sheer belief that passes any pretension. This is music that can actually make you smile.”\n\nThough he had received no formal training before the age of 18, his first experiences singing in college choir changed his life, and he completed his first concert work, Go, Lovely, Rose, at the age of 21. Eric went on to the Juilliard School, earning his Master of Music degree and studying with Pulitzer Prize- and Oscar-winning composer John Corigliano.\n\nMany of Whitacre's works have entered the standard choral and symphonic repertories and have become the subject of several recent scholarly works and doctoral dissertations. His works Water Night, Cloudburst, Sleep, Lux Aurumque and A Boy and a Girl are among the most popular choral works of the last decade, and his Ghost Train, Godzilla Eats Las Vegas, and October have achieved equal success in the symphonic wind community. To date, Whitacre's published works have received thousands of performances and have sold well over 750,000 copies worldwide. He has received composition awards from the Barlow International Composition Competition, the American Choral Directors Association and the American Composers Forum. In 2001, Whitacre became the youngest recipient ever awarded the coveted Raymond C. Brock commission by the American Choral Directors Association. \n\nAs a conductor, Whitacre has appeared with hundreds of professional and educational ensembles throughout the world. In the last ten years he has conducted concerts of his choral and symphonic music in Japan, Australia, China, Singapore, South America and much of Europe, as well as dozens of American universities and colleges where he regularly conducts seminars and lectures with young musicians. Over the past few years, these loyal fans and supporters have moved online, spreading Eric’s popularity to an ever-expanding worldwide audience. Upcoming commissions include works for The King’s Singers with the National Youth Choir of Great Britain, the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, and an oratorio - featuring full orchestra, choir, and soloists – celebrating the opening of the new Long Center for the Performing Arts in Austin, TX.\n\nHis music has been featured on dozens of commercial and independent recordings. His first recording, The Music of Eric Whitacre, was hailed by The American Record Guide as one of the top ten classical albums of 1997. In 2006, a full collection of his a cappella music, Cloudburst and Other Choral Works, was released on the renowned British classical label Hyperion Records. The album quickly became an international best seller, appearing in the top ten of both Billboard’s and iTune’s Top Classical Albums charts. Two years after its debut, the critically acclaimed release continues to be a top-seller. The collection earned a 2007 Grammy nomination for Best Choral Performance.\n\nMost recently, Whitacre has received acclaim for Paradise Lost: Shadows and Wings, a cutting edge musical combining trance, ambient and techno electronica with choral, cinematic, and operatic traditions. Winner of the ASCAP Harold Arlen award, this musical also gained Whitacre the prestigious Richard Rodgers Award for most promising musical theater composer. Following its sold-out run, the most recent production earned 10 nominations at the 2007 Los Angeles Stage Alliance Ovation Awards, including one for Best World Premiere Musical.\n\nMr. Whitacre lives in Los Angeles with his wife, celebrated soprano Hila Plitmann, and their son.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Whitacre\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Lettuce Rage! Release Date: 2008 Label: P-Vine  The second studio set from this sideman supergroup of sorts follows its debut by six years but maintains a similar approach. While the first album recorded by the eight-piece ensemble (that gets together only sporadically between other full time gigs) was funk-influenced, this is pure '70s styled retro funk. Think Earth, Wind & Fire, P-Funk, the Crusaders, Tower of Power, James Brown, Rufus with Chaka Khan, you get the idea. To further cement the old school feel, the band recorded with mics and tube compressors from the era. The result is nearly an hour of non-stop, predominantly instrumental, rump shaking jazz-funk fusion that, while obviously indebted to its predecessors, shimmers with a natural energetic groove of its own. These guys play off each other with enthusiasm and are clearly having a ball. All but two tunes are Lettuce compositions with drummer Adam Deitch (50 Cent, Talib Kweli, John Scofield) writing or co-writing eight selections. The three piece horn section gets all AWB on \"Salute\" and the band finds its Meters \"Cissy Strut\"-ing heart in \"Speak E.Z.\" The Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band's \"Express Yourself\" and Curtis Mayfield's \"Move on Up\" make for two representative and slightly left-of-center covers that fit perfectly with the album's electric boogie vibe, but the rest of the self-penned tracks are nearly as good. The group borrows liberally from its forerunners but does so with such integrity and respect it's impossible to criticize Lettuce for ripping off the licks, lines and riffs of the '70s greats in their record collections. Rather, this is party music made to liven up any shindig and might also encourage some youngsters to search out the sources behind Lettuce's funky blasts. That seems to be at least part of the band's intent. The rest is just to have fun paying tribute to music that inspires them and hope the listener's feelings are mutual.   ~ Hal Horowitz, All Music Guide  @http://music.msn.com/music/album-review/lettuce/rage!/    <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lettuce\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After several years of learning to master the piano, Anton began playing the drums in a band, and composed and produced numerous rocksongs in his band's own studio. In 2009 he began producing electronic clubmusic, to much and quick acclaim. After a period of only few months he attained a remarkable level and participated in Beatport's \"Armand Van Helden / Strictly Rhythm Remix Contest\", which he went on to win. This opened up a number of new possibilities for Zedd, and only shortly after, he won his second contest on Beatport, the \"Fatboy Slim / Skint Remix Contest\"! This was the foundation for several cooperations with artists such as Black Eyed Peas, Lady Gaga, P. Diddy, Skrillex, Fatboy Slim, Armand Van Helden and labels like mau5trap, Interscope, Atlantic, Strictly Rhythm or Skint Records. His first release \"The Anthem\" entered the Beatport charts top 20, and even made it to the second place of Track It Down charts. His remix for Skrillex' 'Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites', released on 'mau5trap recordings' climbed up the charts to #4 on Beatport and #2 on Beatport's Electro House charts. Zedd released his single \"Shave It\" on October 4th 2011 via Beatport under Skrillex's new label OWSLA. \"Shave It\" is Zedd's first single with OWSLA. One of the reasons for this rapid development is undoubtedly Zedd's unique and highly recognizable style of composition. It stands out as very detailed and carefully produced Electro House, very playful and the same time remarkably catchy. Zedd is definitely an artist to look out for in the future... <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Zedd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "John Cameron Fogerty (born May 28, 1945 in Berkeley, California, USA) is an American rock singer, songwriter, and guitarist, best known for his time with the swamp rock/roots rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival and as a solo recording artist.  John Fogerty began a solo career, originally under the name The Blue Ridge Rangers for his 1973 LP debut. Fogerty played all of the instruments on covers of others' country music hits, such as \"Jambalaya\" (which was a Top 40 hit). Prior to performing country & western tunes he released a rock & roll single in late 1973, also as The Blue Ridge Rangers. The two John Fogerty penned songs were \"You Don't Owe Me\" and \"Back In The Hills\" (Fantasy F-710).  In early 1974 John Fogerty released two rock & roll tunes on a 7\"-single. The two songs were the vocal \"Comin' Down The Road\" b/w the instrumental \"Ricochet\". His second solo album John Fogerty was released in 1975. Sales were slim and legal problems delayed a followup, though it yielded \"Rockin' All Over the World\", a top 40 hit for Fogerty in North America.  Fogerty finished an album called Hoodoo in 1976. A single, \"You Got The Magic\" b/w \"Evil Thing\", preceded the album's release, but it performed poorly. The album, for which covers had already been printed, was rejected by Asylum Records a couple weeks before its scheduled release, and Fogerty agreed that it wasn't up to his usual high standards. Fogerty told Asylum Records to destroy the master tapes for Hoodoo sometime in the 1980s. Fogerty is something of a perfectionist, often destroying unreleased material. Fogerty says that he was unable to write music during this period of his life.  Fogerty's solo career re-emerged in full force with 1985's Centerfield, his first album for Warner Bros. Records (which took over co-ownership of Asylum's contract with Fogerty). Centerfield went to the top of the charts and included a top-ten hit in \"The Old Man Down The Road\"; the title track is frequently played on classic rock radio and at baseball games to this day. But that album was not without its legal snags either.  Two songs on the album, \"Zanz Kant Danz\" and \"Mr Greed\", were believed to be attacks on Fogerty's former boss at Fantasy Records, Saul Zaentz. \"Zanz Kant Danz\" was about a pig who can't dance but would \"steal your money\". When Zaentz responded with a lawsuit, Fogerty issued a revised version of \"Zanz Kant Danz\" (changing the lead character's name to Vanz). Another lawsuit claimed that \"The Old Man Down The Road\" shared the same chorus as \"Run Through The Jungle\" (a song from Fogerty's days with Creedence to which Fantasy Records had owned the publishing rights). Fogerty ultimately won his case when he proved that the two songs were wholly distinct compositions.  The followup album to Centerfield was Eye of the Zombie in 1986, which was less successful. Fogerty toured behind the album, but he refused to play any Creedence material. The album took on a darker mood, talking about a troubled society, terrorism, and pop stars selling out. For years, he refused to play material from the Zombie album. However, \"Change In The Weather\" was included in the set list for his 2009 tour. Fogerty played Creedence material again at a concert in Washington, D.C., for Vietnam veterans that took place on July 4, 1987. The show was aired on HBO. Aside from the show at the Palomino, this was the first time Fogerty had performed any Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a large audience since 1972.  Fogerty traveled to Mississippi in 1990 for inspiration and visited the gravesite of blues legend Robert Johnson. He realized that Robert Johnson was the true spiritual owner of the songs Johnson had written. Fogerty decided to start making a new album and to perform his old Creedence material regularly in concert.[4][5] It was at this time visiting the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church cemetery that Fogerty met Skip Henderson, a New Jersey vintage guitar dealer who had formed a nonprofit corporation The Mt. Zion Memorial Fund to honor Johnson with a memorial marker. Fogerty subsequently funded headstones for Charlie Patton, James Son Thomas, Mississippi Joe Callicott, Eugene Powell, Lonnie Pitchford and helped with financial arrangements for numerous others.[6]  Creedence Clearwater Revival was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. John Fogerty refused to perform with his former band mates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony. In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited LA session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by Bruce Springsteen and Robbie Robertson in performing three songs; \"Who'll Stop The Rain\", \"Born On The Bayou\" and \"Green River\".  Fogerty returned to the commercial music industry in 1997 with Blue Moon Swamp. The layoff between Zombie and Swamp had been longer than his mid-'70s-mid-'80s break. The album was much more successful than his previous effort and won the Grammy for best rock album in 1997. A live album of the equally successful tour was released to similar acclaim and good sales.  It seemed as though Fogerty was back, but again he drifted out of the mainstream, only returning after another break in 2004. Deja Vu (All Over Again) was Fogerty’s next release. His new record contract was with DreamWorks Records, which had taken over distribution of Fogerty's Warner Bros. catalog. Rolling Stone wrote: \"The title track is Fogerty's indictment of the Iraq war as another Vietnam, a senseless squandering of American lives and power\". On the album, Fogerty squeezed 10 songs into only 34 minutes.  The sale of Fantasy Records to Concord Records in 2004 ended the 30+-year estrangement between Fogerty and his former label as the new owners took steps to restore royalty rights Fogerty gave up in order to be released from his contract with Fantasy in the mid 1970s. In September 2005, Fogerty returned to Fantasy Records. That was made possible when DreamWorks Records' non-country music unit was absorbed by Geffen Records, which dropped Fogerty but continued to distribute his earlier solo albums. The first album released under the new Fantasy contract was The Long Road Home, a compilation CD combining his Creedence hits with solo material which was issued in November 2005. A live CD and DVD concert was released the following year.  Fogerty’s touring schedule increased in the period after Deja Vu (All Over Again). In October 2004, Fogerty appeared on the Vote for Change tour, playing a series of concerts in American swing states. Centerfield was also played at the 2008 Republican National Convention when John McCain introduced Sarah Palin as his running mate. Fogerty's numbers were played with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Fogerty toured with John Mellencamp in the summer of 2005 and with Willie Nelson in the summer of 2006. On June 29, 2006 he played his first headlining British concert since 1972, at the Hammersmith Apollo theater in London, as part of the European leg of the tour. During that leg, he also performed in Sundsvall, Sweden, where 25,000 people came to see him perform at the town square. On Thanksgiving Day of 2006, Fogerty performed at halftime at the Miami Dolphins/Detroit Lions game as well as at the Denver Broncos/Kansas City Chiefs halftime later that evening.  Alongside, Bill Withers, the Sherman Brothers, Steve Cropper and Isaac Hayes and David Porter, Fogerty was named to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005.  Fogerty features on Jerry Lee Lewis's album \"Last Man Standing\" issued 26 September 2006, duetting on a recording of \"Travellin' Band\". He also participated in the live set follow-up \"Last Man Standing - Live\", joining Lewis for a duet of \"CC Rider\", \"Will The Circle Be Unbroken\" (also featuring Kris Kristofferson), and concluding with a performance of \"Good Golly Miss Molly\", with Lewis backing him on piano.  Fogerty completed his first new country and rock album in three years, Revival, which was released on October 2, 2007. Heavily promoted by the label, Revival debuted at number 14 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart with sales about 65,000 copies in its first week. Revival was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album of 2008 but lost to the Foo Fighters.  On February 10, 2008, he appeared with Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard on the Grammy Award's Show. Along with these rock icons and his regular touring band, he played his ultra-rare 1973 single \"Comin' Down The Road\" leading into Lewis and Richard's performances of \"Great Balls Of Fire,\" and \"Good Golly Miss Molly,\" respectively.  On March 16, 2008, Fogerty kicked off an Australian tour. On March 22 in Point Nepean, Australia, surprise guest Keith Urban joined Fogerty on stage, performing two songs: \"Broken Down Cowboy,\" off Fogerty's newest album Revival, and \"Cotton Fields,\" from CCR's album Willy & the Poor Boys.  Fogerty's current touring band includes Dave Santos on bass, Kenny Aronoff on drums, Matt Nolen on keyboards, guitar & mandolin, Hunter Perrin on guitars Billy Burnette (of Fleetwood Mac fame) on guitars, and Dan Hochhalter on fiddle, mandolin, and guitars.  On June 24, 2008, Fogerty made a return to the Royal Albert Hall, a venue he last played with CCR in 1971. It was the last concert on his 2008 European Tour. This concert was filmed (causing staging problems that annoyed some fans) and, according to his website, is to be released in early 2009.  On December 10, 2008, a Billboard article announced that besides the Royal Albert Hall DVD, Fogerty was working on recording a new album of mostly country covers. The album is a sequel to his 1973 solo debut The Blue Ridge Rangers and will be called The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again. It will be released on September 1, 2009 and will contain a duet with Bruce Springsteen on the 1960 Everly Brothers classic \"When Will I Be Loved?.\"[15] In addition, Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit of The Eagles sing with Fogerty on a cover of Rick Nelson's 1972 classic \"Garden Party.\"  On April 16, 2009, Fogerty performed his hit \"Centerfield,\" from center field, at the opening day festivities of the new Yankee Stadium.[16]  On July 2,3,and 4, 2009 John Fogerty performed with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl. The Bowl was completely sold out. The night included a fireworks display. Although the night was billed as Fogerty with the LA Philharmonic, the LA Philharmonic began the night with music by American composers, and Fogerty and his band came on after intermission and played all of his greatest hits. Fogerty and his band only played one song with the orchestra.  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/John+Fogerty\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Umphrey's McGee is a progressive rock / jam band from South Bend, IN now based in Chicago, IL.  They are influenced musically by progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Dream Theater, and Genesis, as well as heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden. The band also identifies The Police, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences. However, there really isn't a style of popular music that Umphrey's does not cover. Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to Paul Simon.  Formed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands.   In mid-1998, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as Divisions and All in Time.  Shortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.  The addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar). Another live album, One Fat Sucka, was released shortly after, containing live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.  Around 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the \"Jimmy Stewart Ballroom\" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions \"Jimmy Stewart.\" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by \"McL\" in the \"Jimmy Stewart writeup\" on the fan message board known as \"The Bort\" at www.umphreaks.com.  2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, Umphrey's was invited to play the first annual Bonnaroo Music Festival which took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date and ended up selling more CDs than any other artist on the bill including Widespread Panic, Trey Anastasio, and Norah Jones.  In October 2002 drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving to attend medical school. After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.    In 2004, the band released the critically-acclaimed album Anchor Drops, recorded in several different studios throughout the Chicago area. Shortly before the release of the album, the band scored a distribution deal for both Anchor Drops and Local Band Does OK, and for the first time, Umphrey's music was available in stores all over the country. Anchor Drops received rave reviews from several high-profile magazines. Umphrey's was booked to play the Bonnaroo Music Festival once again in June but unlike their 2002 performance, this time they would play a coveted late-night spot. The band performed to over 20,000 people, many of whom had never heard the band before. Shortly after in July, Umphrey's was declared by Rolling Stone Magazine to \"have become odds-on favorites in the next-Phish sweepstakes.\"   In April 2006, Umphrey's released their fourth studio effort, Safety in Numbers. They appeared on the late night TV program Jimmy Kimmel Live in May and were featured at many of the major U.S. festivals throughout the summer, playing 129 shows before a three-night stand in Chicago for New Year's Eve. The Bottom Half, an album of leftover tracks from the Safety in Numbers sessions, was released a year later in April, 2007. It was supported with tours of the U.S., Europe, and Japan.    A live double-album titled Live at the Murat was released in October, 2007. The album was recorded over 2 nights at the Egyptian Room in the Murat Centre in Indianapolis, Indiana on April 6-7, 2007. It received a 4-star review from Rolling Stone Magazine. The album also won a Jammy for best live album. Another live double album release came in June 2008, when the band put out Jimmy Stewart 2007. The album consisted entirely of live, improvised \"Jimmy Stewart\" sessions recorded in 2007.  Umphrey's McGee completed work on their next studio album, Mantis, in late 2008. Recorded mainly in Manny Sanchez’s I.V. Lab Studios in Chicago, the band members began by presenting each other with CDs containing hundreds of musical ideas they’d composed over the past dozen years, which were then shifted and trimmed down to the concise tracks that appear on the album. The band’s longtime sound caresser, Kevin Browning, edited and mixed the album's material.   Mantis became available for pre-order on October 27, 2008. Along with the pre-order announcement came information that unique bonus content would be available and more content would unlock depending on how many pre-orders were placed. This unusual method of distribution has been hailed as the \"perfect way to implement a pre-order campaign\" by Reuters.com.  Mantis was released on January 20, 2009. The album marked Umphrey’s second decade together as a band and was the first Umphrey’s album to consist entirely of material never previously performed on the road. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Umphrey%27s+McGee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Widespread Panic is a rock band which formed in Athens, Georgia, United States in 1986. The band currently consists of John Bell (vocals, guitar), Jimmy Herirng (guitar), Dave Schools (bass), John \"JoJo\" Hermann (keyboards), Domingo \"Sunny\" Ortiz (percussion) and Todd Nance (drums). The band has previously included Michael Houser (guitar) and George McConnell (guitar) and have released 11 albums.  Michael Houser and John Bell ('JB') met at the University of Georgia at Athens between 1982 and 1984, and began playing music together around town as a duet. JB played solo shows as well. In the Fall of 1984, David Schools saw JB play a solo show at Abbots in Athens. Dave and JB were introduced by a mutual friend. Shortly thereafter, JB & Mike recruited Dave to play bass with them, and from Mike's nickname (\"Panic\"), the band name Widespread Panic was chosen. On February 24, 1985 the band played their first performance as Widespread Panic at the A-Frame house on Weymanda Court in Athens. Mike, JB, & Dave performed around Athens as a trio, occasionally utilizing local drummers. While their shows consisted primarily of cover tunes (by the likes of The Grateful Dead, Van Morrison, Bob Marley, and Traffic, among others), their repertoire did include a handful of original songs: Sleepy Monkey (the band's first original composition), Chilly Water, Space Wrangler, and Coconut (written by JB before joining the band). During this time, the trio also met vocalist Kelly Jo Davis (who is later married to blues guitarist and friend of WP, Tinsley Ellis). Kelly Jo performed frequently with the band throughout 1985 and 1986.  February 6, 1986, Mike recruited high school friend/band mate Todd Nance for a WP gig (an Aid For Africa benefit) at the Mad Hatter Ballroom in Athens, opening for Strawberry Flats (featuring John Keane). This is considered the first \"official\" Widespread Panic show. Todd evidently had a good time, and accepted their offer to join the band. On February 9, 1985, Mike, Dave, and JB, with Joel Morris on drums and Kelly Jo Davis on backing vocals, recorded Monkey Image (Sleepy Monkey) and Coconut Image (Coconut) at Panoramic Recording Studio in Arnoldsville GA, to be released as their first single. The 45rpm vinyl was released (in a pressing of only 500) shortly thereafter on the band's Space Baby label.  During the rest of 1986, WP played mainly in Athens, though they did branch out to venues in Macon, GA and South Carolina. Early on, they began playing every Monday night at the Uptown Lounge in Athens, a tradition that would last well into 1988. Along the way, they developed a solid batch of original tunes (in addition to the four originals that they played in 1985), including Stop-Go, C. Brown, Tie Your Shoes, Porch Song, Driving Song, Conrad, Vacation, Postcard, the instrumental Machine, and another instrumental jam that JB later adds lyrics to, titled Cardboard Box. On October 6, 1986, Texan percussionist Domingo S. Ortiz (\"Sunny\"), sat in with the band at the Uptown Lounge for the first time. Sunny continued to perform with the band on numerous occasions in Athens, Macon, and Atlanta, and eventually (late 1988 or early 1989) accepted the band's request for him to join as a full-time member.  During 1987, WP continued to play primarily in Georgia, while steadily spreading out to SC, NC, AL, TN, and as far north as Richmond, VA (Dave Schools' hometown). They developed a few more originals along the way, including Barstools & Dreamers, Contentment Blues, I'm Not Alone, and instrumentals L.a. (aka \"Liza's Apartment\"), and The Take Out. JB added lyrics to Cardboard Box, and to another instrumental titled \"Puppet Song\", subsequently renamed Pigeons. Cardboard Box was only played a handful of times before being dropped from the repertoire. In the Fall, the band signed with Landslide Records and recorded their first album, Space Wrangler, at John Keane's Studio in Athens. Guests on the album included Sunny on percussion, David Blackmon on fiddle, Tim White on keyboards, and Alberto Salazarte (of Athens band White Buffalo) on percussion.  In June of 1988, the first known guest appearance of producer John Keane on stage with the band occurred. Usually playing pedal steel, Keane became another regular guest at special Panic shows.  Their debut LP, Space Wrangler, established a small fan base and inaugurated several years of constant touring before the band signed to Capricorn Records and released their major label debut, Widespread Panic in 1991. After appearing with the H.O.R.D.E. tours for a few years, the band became one of the most popular new jam bands that arose in the mid-1990s. Their popularity peaked in the late 1990s/early 2000s, as their concert draw benefited from Phish's temporary hiatus. They still have a large draw in the South, where they are most popular.   Playing as many as 250 shows a year, Panic built a large fan base. True road warriors, Widespread Panic ranked among the top 50 grossing touring acts for eight years running, even without substantial radio airplay, television exposure, or promotion at retail stores. The band holds sellout records at Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver (23 shows), Oak Mountain Amphitheatre near Birmingham, Ala. (17 shows), Philips Arena in Atlanta (11 shows), and UNO Lakefront Arena in New Orleans (18 shows). Not to mention 20 sellouts at San Francisco's Warfield Theatre, seven sellouts across the Bay at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, nine sellouts at Mud Island in Memphis, seven at Memphis' Mid-South Coliseum, and in October 2003 for the popular Halloween shows sold out two concerts at New York's famed Madison Square Garden. To celebrate the release of their first live album, Light Fuse, Get Away, Widespread Panic offered a free \"CD release party\" concert in the streets of hometown Athens. An estimated 100,000 fans descended on the town, transforming it into the largest CD release party in history.  In August 2002, founding guitarist Michael Houser lost his battle with pancreatic cancer. George McConnell, a long time friend of the band and former Beanland,a Mississippi roots band, member joined in Houser's wake. After Hermann had joined Panic in 1992, McConnell often sat in whenever Panic played in the south. Friends for the past 15 years, Panic and McConnell had often played on the same bill for nearly as long. That longstanding relationship made him the natural choice to continue on with Panic after Michael Houser's death from pancreatic cancer in August of that year. \"It's all about chemistry,\" Schools said. \"We've been friends for 15 years.\" At the end of the summer tour, Panic went back to the studio to record Ball, a testament that, as Houser wished, they would continue as a band.  On August 2, 2006, the band announced that George McConnell would no longer be playing with the band. John Keane, friend and co-producer of many of the bands albums, provided guitar support for the remainder of the tour, along with Sam Holt. Both had been featured contributors in Widespread Panic concerts since the beginning of the Summer 2006 tour. The following day, the band announced that guitarist Jimmy Herring, who had previously been a member of the 1990s band the Aquarium Rescue Unit and had toured with The Allman Brothers Band and members of The Grateful Dead, would join the band, beginning with the first show of the Fall 2006 tour at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York.  The band has sold over 3 million albums, and released a total of 15 CDs and five DVDs (including Live at Oak Mountain, which is certified Gold).   In June 2006, their 9th and most recent studio album, Earth to America, was released. Earth to America was recorded with Terry Manning in Nassau, Bahamas at the beautiful Compass Point Studios.   In late 2006, Fayetteville, NC native Jimmy Herring took over the reins of the lead guitarist in the band, kicking off their fall tour with three nights at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York.  Panic’s 7th annual New Year’s shows on December 30 and 31 of 2007, marked their 15th and 16th sellout performance at Philips Arena.  The band released their 10th album, Free Somehow, on February 12, 2008. It, too, was recorded with producer Terry Manning at Compass Point Studios.  Following the release of the new studio album, Widespread Panic began to release vintage concert performances from the Widespread Panic Archives. Carbondale 2000 was released on June 10, 2008, followed by Valdosta 1989 released on February 24, 2009, and Huntsville 1996 released on June 23, 2009. The band will continue to dig into their show archives, which encompasses the past 25 years, and release these shows as multi-track recordings.  June 27, 2008, marked the band's 32nd sold-out show at Red Rocks Amphitheater. This was more than any other band in the venue's history. Mayor John Hickenlooper proclaimed Friday, June 27 \"Widespread Panic Day\" in the City and County of Denver. The same year, Widespread Panic was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame on September 20.  The band continued to tour throughout the rest of 2008 and the spring of 2009. In the summer of 2009, Widespread Panic teamed up with fellow southern rockers, The Allman Brothers to do a summer and fall co-headlining tour.  In March 2010, it was announced that Widespread Panic would be releasing a new album entitled Dirty Side Down on May 25, 2010. The band is also releasing Live in the Classic City II, containing music from its 2000 shows.  On September 29, 2010, Widespread keyboardist Jojo Herman announced that the band would be going on hiatus in 2012. In an interview with the Vanderbilt Hustler, Herman explained, \"Next year will be our 25th anniversary. After that, we're probably going to call it (quits) for awhile. So we're looking forward to next year and going out on a high note.\"    <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Widespread+Panic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Big Head Todd & the Monsters is a rock band formed in 1986 in Colorado. The band has released eight studio albums since 1989 with their 1993 album Sister Sweetly going well beyond platinum in the US. The band has developed a sizeable live following especially in the Mountain States of the US. \n Big Head Todd and The Monsters – singer-guitarist Todd Park Mohr, bassist-singer Rob Squires, drummer-singer Brian Nevin and keyboardist-guitarist-singer Jeremy Lawton --  could have begun resting on their laurels back in 1993, when their Top 10 singles “Bittersweet,” “Broken Hearted Savior,” “Circle” and “It’s Alright” pushed the album Sister Sweetly to platinum certification. However, Mohr says, “I’ve fought throughout our career not to be a one-trick pony, to be the kind of band that has depth and diversity in its catalogue. I’m a fan of this band, and I’m constantly looking forward to what comes next.”\nThe essence of Big Head Todd and The Monsters – a rootsy, emotionally direct variety of rock ’n’ roll that lends itself particularly well to a live setting – has been winning fans since Mohr, Rob Squires and Brian Nevin started playing together in high school (Jeremy Lawton joined in 2004). Needless to say, the three never expected to be in the same band at this late date, but, as Mohr points out, “It was a really fortunate combination of musical personalities, and we’re still partners in every sense of the word.”\nThe band spent seven years developing their chemistry and amassing a following, boosted significantly by the independent releases Another Mayberry (1989) and Midnight Radio (1990), before being “discovered” by the listening public at large with 1993’s Sister Sweetly. After a major-label stint (Sister Sweetly, 1994’s Stratagem, 1997’s Beautiful World), during which the trio increasingly found itself frustrated artistically, they reclaimed their independent status (2001’s Riviera, 2004’s Crimes of Passion). “If it were not for our ability to do things for ourselves, we would have disappeared a long time ago,” Mohr allows.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Head+Todd+and+the+Monsters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The Black Crowes was a blues-oriented hard rock jam band formed 1989 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States that has sold over 15 million albums and were hailed by Melody Maker as \"The Most Rock N' Roll Rock N' Roll Band In The World\" The band has toured with acts such as Aerosmith, ZZ Top, Jimmy Page, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Oasis and Lenny Kravitz. The Crowes are listed at #92 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".\n\nAt the time of their 1990 debut, the kind of rock & roll the Black Crowes specialize in was out of style. Only Guns N' Roses came close to approximating a vintage Stones-style raunch, but they were too angry and jagged to pull it off completely. The Black Crowes replicated that Stonesy swagger and Faces boogie perfectly. Vocalist Chris Robinson appropriated the sound and style of vintage Rod Stewart while guitarist Rich Robinson fused Keith Richards' lean attack with Ron Wood's messy rhythmic sense. At their best, the Black Crowes echo classic rock without slavishly imitating their influences.\n\nThe Robinson brothers originally formed the Black Crowes in Georgia in 1984. By the time of their 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker, the group comprised Chris Robinson (vocals), Rich Robinson (guitar), Johnny Colt (bass), Jeff Cease (guitar), and Steve Gorman (drums). \"Jealous Again,\" the first single from Shake Your Money Maker, was a moderate hit but it was the band's cover of Otis Redding's \"Hard to Handle\" that made the group a multi-platinum success. \"Hard to Handle\" climbed its way into the Top 40, propelling the album into the Top Ten. The acoustic ballad \"She Talks to Angels\" became the band's second Top 40 hit in the spring of 1991. Shake Your Money Maker would eventually sell over three million copies.\n\nThe Black Crowes delivered their second album, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, in the spring of 1992, adding new lead guitarist Marc Ford and keyboardist Eddie Harsch. It entered the charts at number one, but it didn't have as many hit singles as the debut; none of the singles cracked the Top 40 and only \"Remedy\" and \"Thorn in My Pride\" made the Top 100. Nevertheless, the band established themselves as a popular concert attraction that summer, selling out theaters across America. The Black Crowes' third album, Amorica, arrived in late 1994. Amorica debuted in the Top Ten, but none of the singles from the album made the charts; even though the record went gold, it slipped off the charts in early 1995.\n\nThree Snakes & One Charm, the group's fourth album, was released in July of 1996. The album entered the charts at number 15, but it quickly slipped out of the Top 50. Nevertheless, the album received the best reviews of any Crowes album since The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. Guitarist Marc Ford was fired from the Black Crowes in August, 1997; two years later, the group returned with By Your Side. In mid-2000, the band collaborated with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page on the double-disc Live at the Greek, an eclectic mix of newly recorded Zeppelin covers and additional classic blues cuts. A Tribute to a Work in Progress: Greatest Hits 1990-1999, a 16-track best-of compilation was also released in mid-2000. The Don Was-produced Lions appeared in spring 2001, and a summer tour with Oasis -- the Tour of Brotherly Love -- followed in June. But all was apparently not well with the group, in January of 2002 the band announced that they were on hiatus. Drummer Steve Gorman was fired from the band, and Chris Robinson announced his intentions for a solo career.\n\nThe Black Crowes have since reunited.  All members circa 1992 are back, with the addition of one of their previous bassists, Sven Pipien, and harmony singers Mona Lisa Young and Charity White.  They are enjoying a renaissance within the group as well as with their longtime fan base and have been consistently touring since formally reuniting in March 2005.  In November of 2007, it was announced that North Mississippi Allstar guitarist Luther Dickinson formally joined the band, replacing Paul Stacey. He appears throughout the Crowes' album Warpaint, which was released in March of 2008.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Black+Crowes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard are an Australian psychedelic rock band that formed in 2010 in Melbourne, Victoria. The band consists of Stu Mackenzie (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, flute), Ambrose Kenny-Smith (vocals, harmonica, keyboards), Cook Craig (guitar, bass, vocals), Joey Walker (guitar, bass, keyboards, vocals), Lucas Skinner (bass, keyboards), Michael Cavanagh (drums, percussion), and Eric Moore (drums, percussion, management). They are known for their energetic live shows and prolific recording output, having released two EPs and 15 studio albums since their formation.\n\nTheir EP and first two albums, Willoughby's Beach (2011), 12 Bar Bruise (2012) and Eyes Like the Sky (2013), primarily blended surf music and garage rock, and were released on the band's independent record label, Flightless, founded by Moore in 2012. Their third to eighth albums—Float Along – Fill Your Lungs (2013), Oddments, I'm in Your Mind Fuzz (2014), Quarters!, Paper Mâché Dream Balloon[/akbum] (2015) and Nonagon Infinity (2016)—expanded their sound, including elements of film music, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, folk, jazz, soul and heavy metal.\n\nIn 2017, the band fulfilled a promise to release five studio albums within the year: Flying Microtonal Banana in February; Murder of the Universe in June; Sketches of Brunswick East, a collaboration with Mild High Club, in August; Polygondwanaland, which was released into the public domain, in November; and Gumboot Soup in December. The band released its fourteenth album, Fishing for Fishies, on 26 April 2019, followed by a fifteenth album, Infest the Rats' Nest, released on 16 August that year.\n\nOn the 19th of April they released their first feature-length film, concert movie \"Chunky Shrapnel\". Named after a lyric from the band’s 2017 song Murder Of The Universe, The film combines concert footage from the band’s 2019 European tour with documentary style-filmmaking of King Gizzard behind the scenes. While Chunky Shrapnel does also document the band offstage, the film’s director, Josh Angus Stewart, said that it prioritizes music over personalities. \n\nChunky Shrapnel was originally set to premiere at Melbourne’s Astor Theatre, before the Australian government closed cinemas nationwide to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The film was eventually released and finally available for 24 hours only on vimeo. \n\nThe band members all grew up and went to school in the Deniliquin, Melbourne and Geelong areas. The band started off as a group of friends jamming together, before a mutual friend asked them to play at a show. The band's name was created \"last minute\". Mackenzie wanted to name the band \"Gizzard Gizzard\" while another band member wanted Jim Morrison's nickname \"Lizard King\". They eventually compromised with King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. The artist Jason Galea has created all of the band's album art, and a majority of their music videos.\n\nOn the 25th of August 2020 it was announced that Eric will no longer be an active member or manager of the band, while promising to keep working with them to put out records in the future. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/King+Gizzard+&+The+Lizard+Wizard\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Mac DeMarco is the antithesis to your stereotypical singer-songwriter. Disregarding the seriously somber moments, he replaces them with whimsical and youthful spontaneity, whilst retaining endearing and subtle commentaries. Promptly after leaving his Edmonton garage for Vancouver he embarked on a grand voyage of enlightenment and alcoholic debauchery.\n\nDeMarco’s a weird cat, cultivating an affinity for occult imagery, nudity and social satire. But his most impressive trait is his undeniable and instinctual ability to compose magical pop jangles, which he refers to as “jizz jazz.” His dusted jams have garnished him accolades that are as ever-increasing as his song-writing abilities. Mac's favorite artists are Shuggie Otis, Steely Dan, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Jonathan Richman and The Grateful Dead\n\nDeMarco was born Vernor Winfield McBriare Smith IV on April 30, 1990, in Duncan, British Columbia. He was named after his great-grandfather, Vernor Smith (1864 - 1932), who was the Minister of Railways and Telephones in Edmonton. To spite his absentee father, DeMarco's mom Agnes changed his name to McBriare Samuel Lanyon DeMarco when he was five. Friends and family came to know him as \"Mac.\" He grew up in Edmonton, the capital of Alberta. After high school, DeMarco moved to Vancouver. Calling himself Makeout Videotape, Mac released his debut tape in 2009, entitled Heat Wave.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+DeMarco\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Carrying on the music tradition is a native son and current Lexington, Kentucky resident, Tyler Childers.\n\nPaintsville is located in the Big Sandy River Valley of Johnson County in Eastern Kentucky made famous for its lawlessness, religion, and booze, and a song about a horse thief, a rambling man, and an attempt to gain some good ol’ Appalachian self-justice is what “William Hill” is all about. Following his “Papaw” around to the Kentucky social institutions – church events and barber shops to name a few– as well as a lot of coon hunting with his dad, Tyler has heard a tale or two about the misadventures of a few good ol’ boys and he gives his own spin of these accounts behind a whiskey-soaked voice well beyond his age of 27. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tyler+Childers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "On Jan 10th, 2012 the Santa Barbara, CA based band Rebelution released \"Peace of Mind\" through their own label 87 Music in partnership with Controlled Substance Sound Labs. Peace of Mind was released as a multi-length triple album which includes Peace of Mind: Acoustic as well as Peace of Mind: Dub. Marking the highest chart debut of Rebelution’s career, Peace of Mind debuted at #13 on the Billboard Top 200, #1 Reggae and #1 Independent albums as well as #4 on the iTunes overall album chart. The band previously had four top 10 albums on the Reggae chart and their 2009 release Bright Side of Life debuted at No. 54 on the Top 200 and #1 Reggae.\n\nRebelution kicked off their “Peace of Mind Tour” the day after the release, selling out shows at Philly’s The Electric Factory, The Hollywood Palladium, Denver’s The Fillmore, The Fox Theater in Oakland and Hard Rock in Orlando, FL. The tour made stops in a total of 42 cities across the country.\n\nSummer 2012 was spent supporting O.A.R on their Amphitheatre tour, headlining four amphitheaters in Florida as well as festival performances at Outside Lands, Hangout, Forecastle, Summer Camp, Summer Set, The Allman Bro’s Peach Festival and two performances at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. After completing a Fall tour of the East and South East, Rebelution will be headlining The Hollywood Palladium on New Years Eve, heading to New Zealand for the Raggamuffins Festival in February and headlining their annual Winter Greens Tour around the USA in Feb - May 2013. \n\nPeace of Mind marks the first time Rebelution has expanded beyond their usual self-production enlisting producers Michael Goldwasser (Easy Star All-Stars), Amp Live (Zion-I), Yeti Beats (Kool Keith, George Clinton), Keith Armstrong and Errol Brown (Stephen, Ziggy, Damian, and Bob Marley). The album builds upon the band’s signature style while venturing into new musical genres from the lush strings incorporated into the gentle “Route Around” to the driving guitar and synths throughout “Lady In White”.\n\nRebelution has developed into a front-runner for grassroots, independent and tour driven music groups. Originally formed in 2004, members Eric Rachmany (vocals / guitar), Rory Carey (keyboards), Wesley Finley (drums), and Marley D. Williams (bass) met in college, while residing in Isla Vista, a popular beachside community in Santa Barbara. It was there that the seeds to Rebelution’s future were planted creating inspiring and engaging music that would leave their listeners with the sense that they have the power to make this world a better place. The band continuously tours across the country, ventured to South America and Europe, and has previously performed at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits among others.\n \nContact:\nManagement:  Silverback Artist Management / Raise Up Music\nDean Raise – dean@raiseupentertainment.com\nJon Phillips – Jon@silverbackmusic.net\n \nBooking – Paradigm Agency\nAaron Pinkus – apinkus@paradigmagency.com\n \nJamie Simone\nPFA Media\njsimone@pfamedia.net\n212-334-6116 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rebelution\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "OneRepublic is an American, self-proclaimed \"genreless\", band formed in Colorado Springs in 2002 by Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins.

The song, according to SoundScan Data, is one of only two songs that have reached 3 million legal downloads in history.  A remix of \"Apologize\" was featured on Timbaland's Shock Value and the band's debut album, Dreaming Out Loud, produced by Greg Wells.

    "headlinerBio": "Joshua Winslow Groban (born in Los Angeles, CA , on February 27, 1981) is an American singer known for his mature, dusky baritone voice. His musical style ranges from classical to pop.\n\nAfter only one year in the theatre department at Carnegie Mellon University, his choice school, Groban left when he was offered a recording contract at Warner Bros. Records through David Foster's own 143 Records imprint. With regard to signing Groban, Foster said: \"I love his natural ability in the pop and rock arena, but I love his sense of classics even more. He's a true musical force to be reckoned with\" [5]. Therefore, under Foster's influence, Groban's first album focused more on the classics with songs such as \"Gira Con Me\" and \"Alle Luce Del Sole,\" the first ones decided on by Foster and Groban.\n\nSoon after being picked up by David Foster, Groban went on to perform \"There For Me\" with Sarah Brightman on her 2000-2001 La Luna Tour, featured on her \"La Luna\" Concert DVD, and made his recording debut by singing \"For Always\" with Lara Fabian on the movie soundtrack to A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001). He also became involved in many benefit shows, including the following: \"The Andre Agassi Grand Slam Event For Children\", singing alongside Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Don Henley and Robin Williams; \"Muhammad Ali's Fight Night Foundation\" which honored Michael J. Fox and others; \"The Family Celebration\" (2001) which was co-hosted by President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and David E. Kelley and his wife, Michelle Pfeiffer; and Michael Milken's CapCure event, which raises funds for cancer research.\n\nIn May 2001, Groban played the role of Malcolm Wyatt in the season finale of the television series Ally McBeal, performing \"You're Still You.\" The series creator David E. Kelley was impressed at Groban's performance at The Family Celebration event, and, based on the audience reaction to Groban's singing, Kelley created a character for Josh in this finale. The character of Malcolm Wyatt was so popular, with 8,000 emails from fans, that Groban was asked to come back the next season to reprise his role and perform \"To Where You Are.\"\n\nOn November 20, 2001, Groban's self-titled debut album Josh Groban was released and, over the next year, it went from gold to double-platinum.\n\nOn February 24, 2002, Groban performed \"The Prayer\" with Charlotte Church at the closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympics, and by November, he had his own PBS special Josh Groban In Concert (2002). The following month, he performed \"To Where You Are\" and \"The Prayer\" at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, and joined The Corrs, Ronan Keating, Sting, Lionel Richie and others for a holiday performance at the Vatican in Rome, Italy.\n\nOn November 11, 2003, his second album Closer was released. Josh himself said that he believed that this second album was a better reflection of him and that his audience would be able to get a better idea of him personally from listening to it. \"What most people know about me, they know through my music. This time, I've tried to open that door as wide as possible. These songs are a giant step closer to who I really am and what my music is all about. Hence the title\".\n\nTwo months after Closer was released, it rose on the Billboard charts from number 11 to number one. Both of Groban's albums were produced by David Foster, released under Foster's 143 Records and distributed by Warner Music. His cover of Secret Garden's \"You Raise Me Up\" became very popular on the adult contemporary charts.\n\nJosh also performed in the soundtrack to Troy, composed by James Horner, featured in the song \"Remember Me\" with Tanja Tzarovsk. He also performed in the soundtrack to Robert Zemeckis's 2004 animated film The Polar Express, featured in the song \"Believe.\" The song is composed by Alan Silvestri and Glen Ballard.\n\nDuring the summer of 2004, Josh once again returned to the birthplace of his artistic growth, Interlochen, where he gave a legendary performance to local residents of Michigan and the many, many campers, ranging from elementary school to high school age. He additionally signed many autographs, and spoke about his experiences as a young performer.\n\nOn November 30, 2004, his second live DVD, Live At The Greek, was released. It also ran as a Great Performances special on PBS. Also in 2004, Josh performed \"Remember When It Rained,\" backed by a full orchestra, at the American Music Awards where he was up for Favorite Male Artist in the pop category. Josh and his recordings were nominated for more than a dozen awards in 2004, including the American Music Award, World Music Award, Academy Award, and a Grammy.\n\nOther appearances include The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jay Leno, Larry King Live, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, 20/20, The Today Show, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Super Bowl XXXVIII, and the Rockefeller Tree Lighting.\n\nDuring the first week of September 2006, Groban's latest single entitled \"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\", was exclusively released to AOL's First Listen. On November 7, 2006, Josh released his third studio album, \"Awake.\" He is kicking off his 2007-2008 tour on February 17th in Verona, New York. \n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Josh+Groban\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Comprised of Nick Wold (vocals, guitar) and Nelson (bass, backup vocals), DREAMERS were first introduced to the universe in November 2014 with their self-released, self-titled debut EP. Their colorfully passionate music tugged at heartstrings and had tastemakers dancing around the room all in one fell swoop, with praise pouring in from the likes of Billboard, Spin, Alternative Press, Vice NOISEY, Guitar World, and major buzz from the blogosphere and HypeM heavy hitters like The Wild Honey Pie, Earmilk and Baeble. The band has already shared the stage with such notable artists as The Vaccines, The 1975, Bear Hands, Walk The Moon, Stone Temple Pilots, Oberhofer, and Broncho. \n\nTheir new single “Wolves” immediately caught the ears of SiriusXM’s AltNation and was placed in full rotation. The song climbed the Alt18 Countdown (based on fan votes) - peaking at #7. It also received spins on KROQ and reached #2 on alternative specialty radio's FMQB and KKBB singles charts.\n\nThe band is headed back into the studio this summer to record a follow-up LP to be released in early 2016 via Fairfax Recordings. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dreamers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I am my own ghostwriter. As a society, we become more attached to the creator than to the creation. Music is faceless. My music is for a new generation—one in which people appreciate art for its intrinsic value—Generation WHY.\"\n\n–ZHU, on his decision to maintain anonymity\n\nNow fully in the sun, ZHU returns with new single “Faded.” Though the weekend is almost behind us, “Faded” is yet another perfect soundtrack for late night mischief in the re-emergent producer’s catalog. It features the same infectious synth work and affected falsetto vocals that made both “Moves Like Ms. Jackson” and “Superfriends” such pleasant surprises. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/ZHU\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Jonathan Davis (born April 10, 1970 in Harlem, New York), also known by his stage names Q-Tip, Kamaal the Abstract and The Abstract Poetic, is an American Grammy Award winning rapper, actor, producer and the former leader of the group A Tribe Called Quest. He converted to Islam in the mid-1990s and changed his name to Kamaal Ibn John Fareed. He later moved to Jamaica, Queens, New York as a child. As referenced in the song \"Check the Rhime\", he mostly resided at Linden Boulevard. He released his debut solo album Amplified in 1999 and followed this up in 2008 with The Renaissance. His third release, Kamaal/The Abstract, was recorded in 2002 but was shelved by his label Arista as they didn't believe it had commercial appeal, but it was eventually released on CD in 2009.\n\nThe Q in his name stands for Queens, and it is also said to be a name that represents his ability to get into one’s ears.\n\nEarly career:\nQ-Tip's first appearance on record was on the Jungle Brothers' Straight Out the Jungle in 1988. Besides performing with his popular and successful jazz-influenced hip hop group, Tip also did production work (under his production alias \"the Abstract\" or often — along with fellow Tribe member Ali Shaheed Muhammad and the late Slum Village member Jay Dee — as part of The Ummah) for artists such as Nas (\"One Love,\" from Illmatic, 1994), Mobb Deep (co-producer on \"Give up the Goods (Just Step),\" \"Temperature's Rising,\" and \"Drink Away the Pain,\" from The Infamous, 1995) and even R&B divas Mariah Carey (\"Honey,\" from Butterfly, 1997) and Whitney Houston (\"Fine,\" from Greatest Hits).\n\nSolo career:\nA Tribe Called Quest disbanded in 1998, after which Q-Tip pursued a solo career. His first solo singles, \"Vivrant Thing\" and \"Breathe & Stop,\" were far more pop-oriented than anything he had done in A Tribe Called Quest, as was his solo debut LP for Arista Records, Amplified. His 2002 follow-up, Kamaal the Abstract, although critically acclaimed and issued a catalog number, was never released because the label believed that it did not have commercial appeal. His next album, The Renaissance, was released November 2008.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest reunited in 2006 and played a limited number of dates. The group was composed of its original lineup, including Tip and occasional member Jarobi White. Early the next year, Tip signed a new solo deal with Motown/Universal Records.\n\nAs of late, Q-Tip has been very active, once again happily reunited with the full line-up of A Tribe Called Quest on the 2K7 NBA Bounce Tour and regaining control of his previously label-owned MySpace page. He has filled the page up with demos and rarities, (some of them from Kamaal the Abstract), and has announced he is negotiating for the ownership of the masters of earlier material from his previous labels and plans to release them independently. Currently, he resides in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\n\nQ-Tip has recently stated that he will be forming a hip hop group with fellow rapper Common, called \"The Standard.\"\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Q-Tip\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The Black Keys are a two-man blues-rock group from Akron, Ohio, United States which formed in 2001, consisting of singer and guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney. The band name was inspired by a schizophrenic artist and friend in Akron, who used the term \"black keys\" to describe things he disliked or people he did not trust. The Black Keys have roots in traditional blues and psychedelic rock stylings.\n\nThey released their first album, The Big Come Up, in 2002, followed by Thickfreakness in 2003, and Rubber Factory in 2004. October 2005 saw the release of the DVD Live, recorded live at The Metro Theatre in Sydney, Australia March 18, 2005. In 2006 they released Magic Potion, as well as the lesser-known Chulahoma and a single version of Your Touch.\n\nOne of their trademarks is their preference for simple, lo-fi recording techniques. They refuse to use big-name studios, and do most recording, producing, and mixing themselves. Most of Thickfreakness was recorded in about 14 hours in Carney's basement, using only an early 80's Tascam 388 8-track recorder. Often, their recordings still have background noises (such as an owl hooting).\n\nThe Black Keys have achieved increasing critical acclaim and recognition since their debut album, which itself received praise from Rolling Stone magazine. Time magazine named them one of the \"10 Best Acts of 2003\" (behind OutKast and The White Stripes). They have supported a number of bands: they toured with Sleater-Kinney in 2003, had a short stint opening for Beck, have recently opened for Radiohead on the American leg of their brief 2006 tour, and performed at Lollapalooza in 2005 and 2007. In addition to this, they were also well-liked by influential British radio DJ John Peel and appeared on both Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Late Show with David Letterman. Famous followers of the band include Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead, and Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammet. Matt Helders, drummer for the Arctic Monkeys, can be seen in a Black Keys T-Shirt in an interview on MTV's RAW. \n\nTheir song \"When the Lights Go Out\" was featured in the 2007 film Black Snake Moan, and also on the soundtrack for that movie. The Black Keys were included in the soundtrack of the 2003 movie School of Rock with their song, \"Set You Free\". \"Lies\" was featured in the conclusion of the February 4, 2009 episode of Lie to Me. One of their songs, \"Girl Is on My Mind\", was used in a 2006 Sony Ericsson advertisement, starring the tennis players Ana Ivanović and Daniela Hantuchová, gaining the band more commercial recognition. It was also used in a 2006 Victoria's Secret commercial featuring Heidi Klum and could be heard in the movies Rest Stop and Cashback. Their song \"10 am Automatic\" was used in the video game MLB '06: The Show, The O.C., The Go-Getter, and was also used in a 2007 American Express commercial starring Shaun White. \"Your Touch\" was featured in a 2007 Lee's jeans commercial, and can be heard both in an episode of NBC's Friday Night Lights and in an episode of \"Eastbound and Down\". Their cover \"Grown So Ugly\" can be heard in the background of the going away party in the 2007 film Cloverfield. \"Strange Times\" is used in Grand Theft Auto IV on the in-game radio station Radio Broker. \"Strange Times\" can also be heard during a preview for ABC's The Mole, and the trailer for season three of the Showtime series Dexter, as well as a promo for Gossip Girl. Their song \"Just Got To Be\" is used on the soundtrack for the video game NHL 08, and \"Hard Row\" is featured in the premiere episode of the FX show Sons of Anarchy. Sons of Anarchy has gone on to use \"Keep Me\" in both Episodes 6 and 7, as well as \"Busted\" in episode 7. The song \"Lies\" is featured in the advertising campaign for the third season of HBO's Big Love. \"The Breaks\" can be heard in Guy Ritchie' film RocknRolla. \"Your Touch\" can also be heard in the HBO series \"Entourage\" in the episode \"Manic Monday\", during the opening scenes. The song \"Psychotic Girl\" is featured the episode \"Messin' with the Kid\" in season 6 of One Tree Hill. \"I'll Be Your Man\" is the opening theme song for the HBO show Hungand was also featured in an episode of the FX Network show Rescue Me. \"Your Touch\" can also be heard in the film Zombieland and in an episode of \"Eastbound and Down\" on HBO. The song \"I Got Mine\" has been used in HBO's sports reality series 24/7 Pacquiao-Hatton\" [13] as well as background music for the 2009 American League Championship Series. The song \"Next Girl\" is featured in the in game radio of Saints Row the Third.\n\nTheir fourth record that Danger Mouse produced Attack & Release  was out April 1st 2008. The duo's fifth album is the first one recorded in a proper studio.\n\nThe Band's fifth album, \"Brothers\" was released in spring 2010 and has seen increasing amounts of exposure to the \"Dancing T-Rex\" video for the song \"Tighten Up\" that went viral...until the band asked it to be removed because they felt it made light of their music. A proper video was released later in 2010, featuring Dan Auerbach and Pat Carney at a playground and was pushed on the band's official YouTube channel, as well as through the iTunes and Zune marketplaces.  The track \"Tighten Up\" was also used as the background music for a Subaru Legacy commercial and on the FIFA 2011 Soundtrack.\n\nThe Black Keys' seventh studio album, \"El Camino,\" was released on the 6th of December 2011. Co-produced by Danger Mouse, the album was released to critical acclaim, receiving positive reviews from The Rolling Stones, NME and more. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly commented on \"El Camino\", saying that \"El Camino trades the soulful stylings of Brothers for harder-driving, faster-riffing rock & roll\". At the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, El Camino won the award for Best Rock Album, while \"Lonely Boy\" received multiple honors, taking 'Best Rock Performance' and 'Best Rock Song'. The album has sold 1.4 million copies in the United States to date.\n\nThe Black Keys' eighth studio album, Turn Blue, was released on May 12, 2014 to generally favorable reviews.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Black+Keys\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Galactic is an American jam band from New Orleans, Louisiana, United States.  Originally formed in 1994 as an octet (under the name Galactic Prophylactic) and including singer Chris Lane and guitarist Rob Gowen, the group was soon pared down to a sextet of: guitarist Jeff Raines, bassist Robert Mercurio, drummer Stanton Moore, Hammond organist Rich Vogel, Theryl DeClouet on vocals, and later adding saxophonist Ben Ellman.  The group was started when Raines and Mercurio, childhood friends from affluent Chevy Chase, Maryland, moved to New Orleans together to attend college at Tulane and Loyola Universities, became enamored of the local funk scene, populated by such legendary acts as The Meters and Dirty Dozen Brass Band and inspired by local legends such as Professor Longhair. There they teamed with noted New Orleans drummer Stanton Moore, saxophonist/harmonica (now producer) Ben Ellman, Rich Vogel, and Theryl de Clouet. In 2004, the band parted ways with vocalist DeClouet, and now continue as an instrumental group until 2007 when they released From The Corner to the Block featuring rappers ranging from Juvenile, Chali 2na, Boots Riley, and Lyrics Born. They continue to tour with different vocalists 2011-2012 with Cyril Neville, 2012-2014 with Corey Glover, 2014 with Maggie Koerner, 2015-present with Erica Falls. They have also toured with trombonist Corey Henry from 2009-2016 and trumpet player Shamarr Allen from 2016 to present. They have been releasing albums consistently since 1996.  The band has developed a unique sound as a result of their influences, including: rock, funk, brass band, blues, jazz, hip hop, electronic, and world music. Many of their songs include performances by other artists of various styles of music, like hip-hop artists Boots Riley (of The Coup), Gift of Gab (of Blackalicious) and Chali 2na (of Jurassic 5), to vocalists Macy Gray, Mavis Staples, Allen Toussaint, Irma Thomas, David Shaw, Mystikal, Mannie Fresh, and JJ Grey & Mofro. On the European version of From the Corner to the Block there are two tracks more than on the US version. One of those tracks (\"Valley Of Pain\") features the German rapper Dendemann.  Over the years, the band's sound has evolved from organic New Orleans funk to a more modern style, incorporating elements of hip hop, electronica, fusion, and jazz. This change has been largely characterized by the increased use of electronic effects on guitar, bass, saxophone, and drums. Drummer Stanton Moore uses phrase samplers to sample a rhythm which he can then play over, producing intricate and layered drum sounds. Ben Ellman, saxophonist and harmonica player, often distorts his instruments to the degree that they sound similar to an electric guitar. In 2007, the band began to produce their own albums (mainly Ben Ellman and Robert Mercurio). This opened them up to more studio experimentation and exploration resulting in their loop, edit and production heavy album “YA-KA- MAY”. They have continued to evolve as producers on their last 3 records.  The band is also noted for inviting guest musicians from New Orleans to perform onstage with them. These include: the Soul Rebels Brass Band, The Neville Brothers, Brian Seeger, Corey \"Boe Money\" Henry, George Porter of The Meters, Dirty Dozen Brass Band and Skerik (a saxophone player who is actually based in Seattle, Washington, but is part of Stanton Moore's side project Garage A Trois). The band is often on tour, and have shared the stage with acts including Live, Counting Crows, the Allman Brothers Band, The Roots, Fusebox Funk, Widespread Panic, B.B. King, Mike Doughty (formerly of Soul Coughing), Gift of Gab (of Blackalicious), Jurassic 5, Jack Johnson, Gov’t Mule, The Revivalists, The Record Company, Trombone Shorty and Orleans Ave, Toots and the Maytals, and Steel Pulse.  Galactic performed “I Got It (What You Need)” on Jiimmy Kimmel Live in 2007. They also performed “Back That Ass Up” and “Rodeo” as Juvenile’s band on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2006.  Galactic toured North America in 2012 with Corey Glover and Soul Rebels Brass Band. On March 29, 2012 Galactic appeared with Soul Rebels Brass Band and Corey Glover on Conan show on TBS .  In 2015, they performed Summer Festivals in the US, Canada, and Japan with vocalist Macy Gray.  While on their 2016 tour, Galactic performed on marine themed call-in talkshow, FishCenter Live. They correctly guessed the coloration of a squirrelfish and won points for a zebra moray eel, Eel Hamburger.  Ya-Ka-May was released on Feb 9, 2010 on ANTI-. The album includes guest performances by a range of New Orleans musicians. Long-established performers such as Rebirth Brass Band, Irma Thomas, Big Chief Bo Dollis of The Wild Magnolias, Allen Toussaint and Walter \"Wolfman\" Washington are represented, along with younger performers in the traditional vein, such as Trombone Shorty and Corey Henry, John Boutté, Josh Cohen and Ryan Scully of Morning 40 Federation, and Glen David Andrews, and also Bounce artists Cheeky Blakk, Big Freedia, Katey Red, and Sissy Nobby.  Galactic released a live album in May 2011 titled The Other Side of Midnight: Live in New Orleans.This album includes live versions of many songs on Ya-Ka-May.  On February 21, 2012 Galactic released a new studio album titled Carnivale Electricos which focused on the theme of Carnivale. They invited artists from New Orleans to flesh out the diversity of the town's music in a virtual Fat Tuesday strut across town: the battle chant of Mardi Gras Indian War Chief Juan Pardo and the Golden Comanches; the voice of Mystikal; and the 40-piece Kipp Renaissance High School marching band. For \"Voyage Ton Flag\" they sampled the late accordionist Clifton Chenier and carnival-rock number \"Hey Na Na (Hey Na)\" with David Shaw of New Orleans's Revivalists. Brazil is represented by samba poet Moyseis Marques on \"O Coco da Galinha\" and by Casa Samba, who retake the forro \"Magalenha...\"  On July 17, 2015, Galactic released a new studio album titled Into the Deep. It featured Macy Gray, J.J. Grey, David Shaw, Maggie Koerner, and Mavis Staples amongst others.  On February 15, 2018, Galactic released a single, \"Hold On to Let Go\". The band confirmed that they are hoping for a mid-2018 album release.  On July 15, 2018, Theryl DeClouet died at the age of 66.

    "headlinerBio": "Big Head Todd & the Monsters is a rock band formed in 1986 in Colorado. The band has released eight studio albums since 1989 with their 1993 album Sister Sweetly going well beyond platinum in the US. The band has developed a sizeable live following especially in the Mountain States of the US. \n Big Head Todd and The Monsters – singer-guitarist Todd Park Mohr, bassist-singer Rob Squires, drummer-singer Brian Nevin and keyboardist-guitarist-singer Jeremy Lawton --  could have begun resting on their laurels back in 1993, when their Top 10 singles “Bittersweet,” “Broken Hearted Savior,” “Circle” and “It’s Alright” pushed the album Sister Sweetly to platinum certification. However, Mohr says, “I’ve fought throughout our career not to be a one-trick pony, to be the kind of band that has depth and diversity in its catalogue. I’m a fan of this band, and I’m constantly looking forward to what comes next.”\nThe essence of Big Head Todd and The Monsters – a rootsy, emotionally direct variety of rock ’n’ roll that lends itself particularly well to a live setting – has been winning fans since Mohr, Rob Squires and Brian Nevin started playing together in high school (Jeremy Lawton joined in 2004). Needless to say, the three never expected to be in the same band at this late date, but, as Mohr points out, “It was a really fortunate combination of musical personalities, and we’re still partners in every sense of the word.”\nThe band spent seven years developing their chemistry and amassing a following, boosted significantly by the independent releases Another Mayberry (1989) and Midnight Radio (1990), before being “discovered” by the listening public at large with 1993’s Sister Sweetly. After a major-label stint (Sister Sweetly, 1994’s Stratagem, 1997’s Beautiful World), during which the trio increasingly found itself frustrated artistically, they reclaimed their independent status (2001’s Riviera, 2004’s Crimes of Passion). “If it were not for our ability to do things for ourselves, we would have disappeared a long time ago,” Mohr allows.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Head+Todd+and+the+Monsters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Europe is a Swedish rock band formed in Upplands Väsby in 1979, by vocalist Joey Tempest, guitarist John Norum, bass guitarist Peter Olsson, and drummer Tony Reno. They got a major breakthrough in Sweden in 1982 by winning the televised competition \"Rock-SM\" (Swedish Rock Championships) It was the first time this competition was held, and Europe became a larger success than the competition itself.\n\nSince their formation, Europe has released eleven studio albums, three live albums, three compilations and nineteen music videos.\n\nEurope rose to international fame in the 1980s with their third album, 1986's The Final Countdown, which has sold over 3 million copies in the United States and 15 million copies worldwide (including album and single). Europe has sold over 25 million records worldwide. The band has had two top 20 albums on the Billboard 200 chart (The Final Countdown and Out of This World) and two top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (\"The Final Countdown\" and \"Carrie\").\n\nEurope went on hiatus in 1992, reunited temporarily for a one-off performance in Stockholm on New Year's Eve 1999 and announced an official reunion in 2003. Since then the band has released six albums, Start from the Dark (2004), Secret Society (2006), Last Look at Eden (2009), Bag of Bones (2012), War of Kings (2015) and Walk The Earth (2017). They continue to have popular tours.\n\nEurope has achieved new attention in the US due to being featured in a GEICO Insurance cable television commercial campaign viewed for many months across the US in 2015-16.\n\nThe band is mainly influenced by Whitesnake, Deep Purple, Rainbow, Led Zeppelin, Thin Lizzy, UFO and Michael Schenker Group.\n\nBorn in 1979 from the underground rock music scene in the outskirts of Stockholm, Sweden, a young band called 'Force' sprung from the suburbs to win national acclaim in the early 80s, emerging victorious in a nationwide talent contest. Their main influences were arena-ready British hard rock bands of the 70s such as UFO, Thin Lizzy, and Led Zeppelin. Winning a recording contract, core members Joey Tempest (vocals), John Norum (guitar) and John Leven (bass) re-named themselves 'Europe'.\n\nThey went on to record and release two spirited albums, 'Europe' and 'Wings of Tomorrow'. They broke through the musical mainstream in both Scandinavia and Japan. The band toured widely on the strengths of these two records, and, in 1984, they recruited new members Mic Michaeli (keyboards) and drummer Ian Haugland. The success these albums generated on their home soil as well as in the Far East landed them an international record deal with Epic Records in New York.\n\nIn 1986, Europe went on to release their third album, 'The Final Countdown', which was produced by Kevin Elson (who had notably worked with Journey and Mr Big). Upon its release, gaining major momentum from Moscow to Manhattan and Stockholm to Sydney and elsewhere, that album conquered the airwaves and the epic arena rock anthem that was its title track succeeded in penetrating the global psyche. The prominent (and now arguably legendary) keyboard riff and memorable melodies catapulted \"The Final Countdown\" into the top ten charts in the U.K and U.S., and it ended up reaching number one in 24 countries. Selling in excess of six million units and resulting in an extensive world tour, 'The Final Countdown' became a global phenomenon. \n\nIt was at this time that John Norum chose to leave Europe to pursue a solo career, and he was replaced by another well-known Swedish guitarist, Kee Marcello. About two years later, Europe emerged again with their fourth album, titled  'Out of This World'. Produced by Ron Nevison (who had worked with UFO, Thin Lizzy, and Heart), this album delivered what had become the trademark Europe melodies and inspiring musical arrangements. Also a remarkable success, Europe embarked on a second world tour, and they notably were the first international rock-act to perform behind the 'Bamboo Curtain' in Bombay, India in front of a 60,000-strong audience.\n\nThe follow-up to 'Out of This World' approximately came two years later. That album, titled 'Prisoners in Paradise', was inspired by the band's time residing in Los Angeles, California. Upon completion of yet another world tour in 1993, the members of Europe decided to take time out to pursue personal projects and record solo albums. \n\nAfter an extended hiatus, the band came together again in 1999 (including original guitarist John Norum) on new year's eve in Stockholm Sweden to perform \"Rock the Night\" and \"The Final Countdown\", helping to usher in the new millennium. The performance not only marked Europe's first public appearance in almost a decade but also inspired a permanent reunion. Still, the band's members had difficulties getting their plans to come together.\n\nIn 2004, with John Norum firmly back in the band, the original Europe lineup returned to the world stage with \"Start From the Dark\" - a raw, cutting-edge rock album that delivered a brand new style of melodic rock. The release saw the band's welcome return to the road as they embarked on an extensive tour in Europe, the United States, and the Far East. Shortly thereafter, the band returned to the studio to record their 7th studio album titled \"Secret Society\" which was released in October 2006. Marking the most daring and innovative Europe album to date, \"Secret Society\" is both a return to their roots as well as a celebration of their collective musical experience and willingness to explore brand new territories. Followed by another world tour, the band continues to work hard to establish themselves yet again. It can be said that there are few bands from the 80's that still remain creative and relevant today with an edgy and modern sound.  \n\nFollowing their summer 2008 European tour, Europe returned to the studio to record and then release their eighth studio effort, \" the Last Look at Eden.\" The band's latest work is \"Bag of Bones,\" which they released in April 2012. Vocalist Joey Tempest remarked that he thought he'd \"made a hardcore classic rock record with the blues knocking on the door.\" Showing that the group has still got it, the album debuted at #2 on Sweden's top album chart and has been certified Gold in Sweden while also receiving strong sales throughout Europe and in the U.K.\n\nwww.europetheband.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Europe\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "There is more than one artist named The Movement: \n1) rock/reggae/hip hop band from Philadelphia, PA\n2) MOD band from Copenhagen, Denmark. http://themovement.dk/\n3) techno group from Los Angeles, CA\n4) grime collective from London, UK\n5) Indie/Rock band from Dublin, Ireland\n\n1) The Movement is a rock/reggae/hip hop band originally formed in Columbia, South Carolina, USA in 2004. The original lineup consisted of Josh Swain, Jordan Miller and Jon Ruff (DJ Riggles).\nIn March 2004 they released their first studio album, On Your Feet, which was recorded and mixed in 24 studio hours at Pat Casey's Modern Music Studios in Columbia, South Carolina. On Your Feet has proved a mainstay of the reggae/rock genre and is listed at #9 on ThePier.org's 10 Essential Reggae Rock Albums.\nThe band continued to build their following with nonstop touring throughout the Southeastern United States. They enjoyed success in opening for national acts such as Steel Pulse, Blues Traveler, Slightly Stoopid, The Wailers, Ludacris, G. Love & Special Sauce, Common, Long Beach Shortbus, Wu-Tang Clan and 311. Their fanbase was growing steadily but the band wasn't breaking any new ground and the trio began losing interest. After DJ Riggles left the band, the remaining duo found themselves at a crossroads until meeting Philadelphonic Studios producer Chris DiBeneditto (Philadelphonic Records), who was looking for new talent to work with and, having seen the band several times, knew they had enormous potential. Swain and Miller dedicated themselves to their craft and made the move to Philadelphia to record their newest material at Philadelphonic. Chris put his experience with G. Love & Special Sauce, Slightly Stoopid and The Expendables to work on what was to become The Movement's second studio album, 2008's Set Sail. To solidify the band's lineup, DiBeneditto contacted local drummer Gary Jackson to sit-in with Swain and Miller. The three hit it off immediately and Jackson brought in his friend, guitarist Jay Schmidt, to play bass. The four of them proved to be a dynamic quartet and so the current lineup was settled. In late 2010 Swain left the band and Miller took over lead vocals. Miller enlisted the help of an old friend John Bowling (Johnny Keys) to join the band and play keyboard. The new lineup went into the studio in the fall of 2011 to record a new album One More Night which was released in March of 2012. On April 20, 2012 the band suddenly broke up and canceled the rest of the tour. Miller stated he needed a break while Schmidt stated that Miller left to pursue a solo career. In May 2012, it was announced that Swain would rejoin the band and assume lead vocals once more. Bowling had already left the band following the breakup the previous month. The new trio of Swain, Jackson, and Schmidt would continue on. They are slated to release a new album in the Summer of 2013 entitled, Side by Side.\nAfter extensive touring across the United States, The Movement has found new life and is currently gaining huge momentum on the shoulders of their well-received sophomore album.\nTour dates and live tracks can be found at their official website, www.themovementvibe.com.\n\n2) The Movement is a power-trio from Copenhagen/Denmark.\nThey play mod-rock with elements of ska.\nTheir sound is influenced by The Jam, The Who and The Clash.\nThe Movement is a well dressed band who always wears suits,\nthey know the old mod-slogan:\n“clean living under difficult circumstances”\nThere are two interpretations of the groups name “Movement”\nMOVING TO MUSIC:\nThe Movement is a high energetic band. They really kick off on stage\nand people can’t stand still, they just have to move.\nIt’s pretty simple and very basic:\nThey are a great live band and they got a unique power pointed directly\nat the audience.\nPOLITICAL MOVEMENT:\nThe Movement is strongly committed to serve\nthe working class.\nThe main goal is to encourage young people to resist\nand question everything.\nIn that matter The Clash has been a great influence:\n“Politics and poetry”.\nTheir influences range from Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Marx\nto Joe Strummer and Paul Weller\n\n3) A techno group from Los Angeles, California consisting of musicians AJ Mora, Richard \"Humpty\" Vission with rapper/DJ/producer/dancer DJ Hazze, produced by Walter \"Kandor\" Kahn.

    "headlinerBio": "This 26 year old singer-songwriter from Decatur, Georgia is out to revive the passion and soul of the Golden Age of Rhythm and Blues (1960-1972) for a new generation. His One Haven/Columbia debut album, This Is Ryan Shaw, combines a powerfully expressive voice with a clutch of great songs both classic and new and a state of the art, in your face sound that makes it impossible to sit still.\n \nWorking with player/producers Jimmy Bralower and Johnny Gale, Ryan dug deep into the “soul mine” for overlooked gems by obscure artists like the Combo Kings and the Sharpees along with more familiar songs made famous by Wilson Pickett, Jackie Wilson, and Bobby Womack. Ryan’s original tunes—“Nobody” (the first single), “We Got Love,” and “Over and Done” —are most definitely of the moment but built on the old-school values of strong melodies and meaningful lyrics.\n\nRyan delivers every song with the kind of emotional commitment and vocal panache that have nearly van¬ished from the mainstream musical landscape. Compositional craft and studio technology blend in an album of irresistible appeal from the opening dance blast of “Do the 45” to the heart-wrenching ballad “I Am Your Man” and “Over and Done,” the upbeat Ryan Shaw original that closes the set on a joyful, triumphant note.\n\nOn stage, Ryan brings it all together with a combination of Southern warmth and New York vitality. Using just a small rhythm section and two male backing vocalists, he’s able to effectively reproduce the sound of his album while stretching some tunes into full-on vocal rave-ups. Ryan’s thrilling voice and charismatic presence are all that he needs to get over with an audi¬ence. There’s no posturing or mindless booty-shaking, no need for contrived antics: Ryan Shaw is the real deal. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Shaw\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Wu-Tang Clan is a hip-hop group that consists of: RZA, GZA/Genius, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa. They are frequently joined by fellow childhood friend Cappadonna, a quasi member of the group. They were formed in (and are associated with) the New York City borough of Staten Island (referred to by members as \"Shaolin\"), though Masta Killa and GZA are from Brooklyn and Inspectah Deck is from the Bronx. They have gone on to become multi-platinum record producers, Grammy winners, TV and film stars, screenwriters, product spokespersons, business owners and, most recently, major motion picture composers. The Clan featured nine MCs until the death of Ol' Dirty Bastard in 2004. One of the most critically and commercially successful hip hop groups of all time, Wu-Tang Clan shot to fame through their uncompromising brand of hardcore rap music. Since their debut, they have introduced or launched the careers of numerous other artists and groups, and already in 1994 there were credited to be over 300 Wu-Tang Clan affiliates, known as the Wu-Tang Killa Bees, consisting of rappers, producers, and record label CEOs.\n\nThe founders of the Wu-Tang Clan were RZA, GZA, and Ol' Dirty Bastard, who had previously formed the group Force of the Imperial Master (later known as All In Together Now after the release of a popular single by that name). The group attracted the attention of some notable figures in the industry, including Biz Markie, but did not manage to secure a record deal. After the crew dissolved, GZA and RZA (then known as Prince Rakeem) embarked on their solo careers with Cold Chillin' Records and Tommy Boy Records respectively, but to little success. Their frustration with the workings of the hip hop music industry would provide the main inspiration to Wu-Tang Clan's revolutionary business plan. According to The Wu-Tang Manual, at the group's inception, RZA promised the members that if he had total control of the Wu-Tang empire, it would conquer the hip hop world within a dynastic cycle, after which he would relinquish his total control.\n\nWu-Tang Clan was gradually assembled in late 1992 from friends and accomplices from around Staten Island, New York, with RZA as the de-facto leader and the group's main producer. Two of the cousins, GZA (pronounced Jizza) and RZA (pronounced Rizza), created their new Wu-Tang aliases by mimicking the sound that the words \"genius\" and \"razor\" would make when scratched on a turntable.\n\n\"Wu-Tang\" comes from the name of the Taoist holy mountain Wu Dang in northwest Hubei Province in central China; it was also the site of the Ming Dynasty Purple Imperial City built during the reign of the Yongle Emperor in the early 15th century. RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard adopted the name for the group after seeing the kung fu film Shaolin and Wu Tang, which features a school of warriors trained in Wu-Tang style. The group's debut album loosely adopted a Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang theme, dividing the album into Shaolin and Wu-Tang sections and using dialogue excerpts as skits.\n\nThe group have also developed various backronyms for the name (as hip hop pioneers like KRS-One and Big Daddy Kane did with their names), including \"We Usually Take All the Niggas' Garments,\" \"Witty Unpredictable Talent and Natural Game\" and \"Wisdom, Universe, Truth, Allah, Nation, and God\".\n\nMethod Man has also mentioned that the \"Wu\" is the sound a sword makes when cutting through the air, and \"Tang\" is the sound it makes against a shield.\n\nThe Clan first became known to hip hop fans, and to major record labels, in 1993 (see 1993 in music) following the release of the independent single \"Protect Ya Neck\", which immediately gave the group a sizeable underground following. Though there was some difficulty in finding a record label that would sign Wu-Tang Clan while still allowing each member to record solo albums with other labels, Loud/RCA finally agreed, releasing their debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), in late 1993. This album was popular and critically-acclaimed, though it took some time to gain momentum. Though hip hop had long had a gritty texture, the surreal aggression and minimalist production of 36 Chambers nevertheless had a huge impact on the genre, and was to prove massively influential over the next decade. By the beginning of the 21st century, the album had become a regular fixture on \"Best Albums of the 90s\" lists as well as a frequent choice for \"Best Albums of All Time\" lists. The success of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) established the group as a creative and influential force in early 1990s hip hop, allowing GZA, RZA, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa to negotiate solo contracts.\n\nwww.wutang-corp.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Wu-Tang+Clan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "John Prine (born October 10, 1946 in Maywood, Illinois) is an American country/folk singer-songwriter who has achieved widespread critical (and some commercial) success since the early 1970s.\n\nThe son of William Prine and Verna Hamm, his grandfather had played guitar with Merle Travis and he started playing guitar himself at 14 years old. He was a postman for 5 years and spent a couple of years in the army before starting his musical career in the Chicago area. He emerged in 1971 with a highly acclaimed debut album titled John Prine. He and friend Steve Goodman (another folk singer-songwriter) had been minor stars in the Chicago folk scene before being \"discovered\" by Kris Kristofferson. The album John Prine included his signature songs \"Illegal Smile\", \"Sam Stone\", and the environmentalist newgrass standard \"Paradise\". The album also included \"Hello In There\", a song about aging that was later covered by Joan Baez, Bette Midler, and Eddi Reader, and \"Angel From Montgomery\", a song now also associated with Bonnie Raitt, who occasionally brings Prine on-stage with her for live performances of the song. The album received many positive reviews, and some hailed Prine as \"the next Dylan\". Bob Dylan himself appeared unannounced at one of Prine's first New York City club appearances, anonymously backing him on harmonica.\n\nLater albums include Sweet Revenge (1973, containing such Prine fan favorites as \"Dear Abby\", \"Grandpa Was A Carpenter\", and \"Christmas In Prison\"), and Common Sense (1975, with \"Come Back To Us Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard\").\n\nIn 1991 Prine released the Grammy Award-winning  The Missing Years, his first collaboration with producer and bassist Howie Epstein. The title song records Prine's humorous take on what Jesus did in the unrecorded years between his childhood and his ministry. In 1995 Prine released Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings, another collaboration with Epstein. In 1997 Prine followed with In Spite of Ourselves, which was unusual for Prine in that it contained only one original song; the rest were covers of classic country songs. All were collaborations with Prine's favorite female country vocalists, including Lucinda Williams and Iris DeMent.\n\nIn early 1998 Prine was diagnosed with throat cancer, but survived after an operation to remove the tumor and this has added gravel to his voice. In 2003 he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award for songwriting by the UK's BBC Radio 2 and that same year was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. The following year saw his classic \"Sam Stone\" covered by Laura Cantrell for the Future Soundtrack for America compilation.\n\nIn 2005, Prine released his first all-new album since In Spite of Ourselves. This new album, Fair and Square, tends toward a more laid-back, acoustic approach than, for example, Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings. The album contains songs such as \"Safety Joe\", about a man who has never taken any risks in his life, and also \"Some Humans Ain't Human\", Prine's protest piece on the album, which talks about the ugly side of human nature and includes a quick shot at President George W. Bush. Fair and Square won the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album.\n\nThe 2005 Americana Music Awards marked another significant achievement for Prine. At the September 9th ceremony, Prine was honored with the Artist of the Year award, which was accepted in his name by awards host and long-time friend Billy Bob Thornton. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/John+Prine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Tenacious D (often referred to as \"The D\" and sometimes introduced as \"The Greatest Band in the world. Period.\") is an American satirical rock duo formed by musicians and actors Kyle Gass and Jack Black in Los Angeles, California in 1994. Their music fuses vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music in a style that critics have described as \"mock rock\". The band first gained reputation in 1999, starring in a self-titled HBO TV series. The drumming on both of their albums and the devils voice on the track Beelzeboss (also the one who plays Satan in The Pick of Destiny movie) was performed by Dave Grohl (of Nirvana, Foo Fighters,  Queens of the Stone Age, and Them Crooked Vultures fame).   Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and Gass' acoustic guitar playing abilities. Their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and cannabis usage. Their debut self-titled album features absurd and humorous sketches. Music critics have compared the storyteller-style lyrics of their songs to lyrics of rock opera. In addition, they have since recorded two albums, and starred in their own movie, Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.  Black and Gass, at the time respectively aged 16 and 24, met in Edinburgh, Scotland during the Edinburgh Fringe of 1989. Both were members of the Los Angeles-based theatre troupe, The Actors' Gang which was performing Tim Robbins and Adam Simon's play Carnage. Initially Black and Gass did not get on as Gass felt threatened by Black - as he was the main musician for the Actor's gang - but they eventually worked out their differences, and agreed to form a band. Gass taught Black to play guitar, in exchange for Black's helping him with his acting.  Initially, Black and Kyle covered songs by Bobby McFerrin. Later they chose the name \"Tenacious D\" - a name derived from a term used by sports commentator Marv Albert about the tenacious defense of the NBA's New York Knicks - decided by the audience of the band's first live show, in 1994 at the now defunct Al's Bar. Other possibilities had included \"Pets or Meat\", \"Balboa’s Biblical Theatre\" and \"The Axe Lords Featuring Gorgazon’s Mischief\", which Gass described as being his personal favorite. In attendance was David Cross who later cast Tenacious D in his sketch comedy television series, Mr. Show.  TV series:  David Cross, with the writer Bob Odenkirk from Mr Show, continued his involvement with Tenacious D by producing three half-hour shows based on the band. The series, entitled Tenacious D, premiered in 1997, immediately following an episode of Mr. Show. While a total of three episodes consisting of two shorts, ten to twelve minutes in length, were produced, only the first was aired that year; the final two episodes did not air until the summer of 2000. The series was canceled after, according to Gass, HBO offered Tenacious D ten episodes, but in doing so, they would have to relinquish their role as executive producers. Gass and Black decided to make a movie instead. Many songs that eventually were included on the band's first album were first featured on the show, though the episodes also contain songs that remain unreleased.  The six shorts were titled \"The Search for Inspirado\", \"Angel in Disguise\", \"Death of a Dream\", \"The Greatest Song in the World\", \"The Fan\", and \"Road Gig\". After the series aired, the band continued to perform. At a show at the Viper Room in Los Angeles, they met Dave Grohl, who remarked that he was impressed with their performance; this led to their cameo in the Foo Fighters' \"Learn to Fly\" music video. The popularity of Tenacious D further increased as they began to open for high profile acts, including Beck, Pearl Jam, and Foo Fighters.  Lyrics and themes:   The Devil CardSatire and comedy are a major aspect of Tenacious D's lyrical content. Gass said of their approach: \"I'd love to do the straight music thing, but that's kind of against our mission, which is to rebel against the serious singer-songwriter mentality.\" Their songs evoke heavy metal clichés of bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. In particular, the song \"Dio\" pokes fun at the idea of a torch being passed \"Now it's time for him to pass the torch\" Songs like \"Friendship\" parody the lack of real friendship in rock groups with the lyric \"As long as there's a record deal, we'll always be friends\" Other songs cover the topic of sex; \"Kielbasa\" discusses anal sex, while \"Double Team\" boasts of the duos sexual prowess. Tenacious D also employs the technique of deliberate backmasking on \"Karate\", a technique synonymous with bands like Slayer, who recorded a message in Hell Awaits.. The band's imagery also continues the theme of evil. The front cover of Tenacious D features Black and Gass standing naked below the Devil. Black described it as he and Gass being \"schooled by Satan\". The pose is similar to that shown on the Devil tarot card. The Devil card signifies sexual desire, uncontrolled energy, vice and addiction.  Tenacious D's music has been criticized for its frequent use of profanity. In addition, other critics have described the band as having exhausted the joke of \"cock rock\".  Influences:  Black has said that the first song he enjoyed was ABBA's \"Take a Chance on Me\". He attributes influences from Dio, Black Sabbath, Meat Loaf and Bobby McFerrin. Gass describes their influences as being derived from \"big dinosaurs of rock\" such as Led Zeppelin. In addition, Gass lists his influences as being Tom Waits, Tony Hawk and Tony Robbins. The band claimed that the inspiration for the song \"Tribute\" came after Black played Metallica's \"One\" for Gass, describing it as \"the best song in the world\", leading to a failed attempt to themselves write an even better song.  Gass has described Tenacious D's comic assertion that they are the best band as being \"ridiculous because it's a matter of opinion\". Black characterizes Tenacious D's comic nature as an antidote to \"the masculinity of rock\", adding \"There's also something funny about the macho-ness of rock. Like the bands that are the fucking hardest rocking are like, 'We'll fucking kick your ass, dude... with our rock.'\"  Tenacious D is featured in the highly anticipated video game \"Guitar Hero III\".  `The Metal' is prominently featured in the game's trailer released at E3 2007.  Tenacious D also did backing vocals on the Styx song \"Kiss Your Ass Goodbye\". It can be found on the album \"Cyclorama\" from 2003.  They were included in Rock Band 2 with their song \"Master Exploder\".  In October of 2009 Jack Black starred as roadie Eddie Riggs in the open world video game Brütal Legend by Double Fine Productions on the XBOX 360 and Playstation 3. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tenacious+D\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Shakey Graves, aka Alejandro Rose-Garcia from Austin, Texas, plays a gnarly composite of blues and folk as a one-man-band of epic sonic proportions. The sound emitted from his hollow body guitar, mildly distorted amp and suitcase drum belie the young singer’s lean frame. He fingerpicks while keeping time with a double-pedal kick drum, hitting a snare fitted into his suitcase drum and a tambourine fashioned to its side. And when he sings, Rose-Garcia unleashes an unearthly howl. Gritty groans and sexy moans carry his stories of both accepting and trying to overcome personal challenges masked with old-timey Western imagery.  His first full-length album, Roll the Bones, which was self-released in 2011 and landed him a spot as the official busker of the Railroad Revival Tour with Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros, Mumford & Sons and Old Crow Medicine Show. Much more mellow than his current live performances, Roll the Bones highlights Rose-Garcia more as a lo-fi singer-songwriter, playing acoustic guitars and occasionally taming his growl to a whisper.  The son of artistic parents — his father was a longtime manager of the Paramount Theatre and his mother is an actress, director and writer — Rose-Garcia was always encouraged to pursue his musical and dramatic ambitions, and he clearly feeds off the wildly different personalities and talents of creative communities.  After his early stumbles in New York, he quickly earned respect in an inventive weirdo folk community; his stories of a Los Angeles scene centered in a garment warehouse converted into a loft/speakeasy have Moulin Rouge-level craziness. In Austin he’s connected with a community of musicians focused around Annie Street, while also bonding with indie bands such as Marmalakes, the Sour Notes, Wild Child, Hello Wheels, Whiskey Shivers and more.  Of course, none of those rock or country-influenced bands sound very much like Shakey Graves, and Rose-Garcia said their kinship is founded mostly on hard work and a desire to make the most of their talent in Austin and beyond.  For him that means a year that will be spent mostly on the road — he was among the first acts confirmed for South by Southwest 2013 and is booked for West Texas’ Utopia Fest and the Pickathon in Portland, Ore. — and weighing the biggest decisions of his still-young career.   <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Shakey+Graves\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The John Butler Trio is an eclectic roots/jam band from Australia led by guitarist and vocalist  John Butler. They have independently released five studio albums, the last three of which debuted at #1 in Australia, and have had eight Top 40 singles. Having developed a great reputation as a live act, the band have also released three live albums. Apart from their little-known debut album, all of their releases have been on Jarrah Records, co-owned by Butler and The Waifs.  John Butler was born on April 1, 1975 in Torrance, California, to an Australian father and American mother. He moved to the small Western Australian town of Pinjarra in January 1986, when he was eleven. Butler began playing guitar at the age of sixteen, and by 1996 started his career as a busker in Fremantle, Western Australia. The John Butler Trio was formed in 1998 when Butler was joined by Gavin Shoesmith on bass and Jason McGann on drums, and by the end of that year had recorded their debut album John Butler.  They then released Three in 2001,  Sunrise Over Sea in 2004 and  Grand National in 2007, all of which were certified platinum.  In June 2009, a new line up of the ever evolving John Butler Trio emerged. Prominent Melbourne musician Nicky Bomba of Bomba fame and principal drummer on Sunrise Over Sea joined the band on drums and percussion, as did bass player Byron Luiters from Sydney outfit Ray Mann Three.   The latest album entitled April Uprising came from a journey John Butler undertook for the ‘Who Do You Think You Are’ TV series. He traces the Butler name through generations of hardship to a matriarch who sang for her survival and follows his Bulgarian ancestry to a forebear caught up in a violent revolt called the April Uprising. The recording process for the new album was shared with avid followers via a special studio sessions page on the band’s website.  John Butler comments on the forthcoming new album, “The whole rehearsal and recording process so far has been a lot of fun and very gratifying. I feel the sounds and general spirit and energy of this album are best summed up in the words – free, melodic, funky, phat and rocking. There’s definitely a certain attitude that comes across on the album. Perhaps there’s a conviction, in a song writing and production sense, that I haven’t tapped into so much on earlier works that seems to be more prevalent on April Uprising. There’s chemistry and language that Nicky, Byron and I have found that really compliments these songs in all their different facets”.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+John+Butler+Trio\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Born and raised in Denver, Colorado, Amanda has been singing and playing guitar since she was 11 years old. Partaking in vocal competitions ever since, Amanda's shown her talents across country. Picking up each individual cities' style, Amanda tried a bit of R&B, hip hop, and rock, each drawing from her musical inspirations growing up. Amanda was influenced by heavy hitter females Lauryn Hill, Janis Joplin, Gwen Stefani, Mariah Carey, and also took notes from legends like Crosby, Stills & Nash, Luther Vandross, and Bruce Springsteen. \n\nAround the age of 15 Amanda gravitated towards a more soulful / R&B style. She found the demand was high for singing hooks for a number of hip hop acts, and she assembled a collection of over 200 songs with her guest vocals. Continuing her path in music beyond high school, Amanda moved to Los Angeles in 2006 to attend the Musician's Institute. While in Los Angeles, she was one of thousands auditioning for 2007's American Idol. Making it the final 50, Amanda was cut in the final round before choosing LA's winning contestants. \n\nAmanda decided to head back to Denver after her brief time in LA, but not giving up on her dreams of singing & songwriting. Needless to say, it hadn't been an easy journey for Amanda, but while she continued to perform locally, her demo 'Who is Jane Doed?' fell on the desk of Joey Carvello, the man responsible for breaking Marc Anthony, Pitbull, Lil Jon, and the Ying Yang Twins. Immediately drawn to her stripped down/authentic sound of Amanda, he contacted his label partners at Strictly Rhythm to find out more about the girl in Denver. Within 3 weeks of the first listen, Amanda became the newest addition to Strictly's roster and the pieces began to assemble... how do we get the world to know Amanda Hawkins? <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Amanda+Hawkins\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "\nKraftwerk (\"power plant\" in English) is an electronic band founded in 1970 in Düsseldorf, Germany. They pioneered electronic music in the 70s and are considered one of the most important and influential bands of their genre, often described as \"the godfathers of electronic music\". Kraftwerk's sound is minimalistic and strictly electronic; it combines driving, repetitive rhythms with catchy melodies and vocals usually sung through a vocoder. The current line-up consists of Ralf Hütter (the only original member), Fritz Hilpert, Henning Schmitz and Stefan Pfaffe. The other founding member Florian Schneider left the band in 2008.\n\nRalf Hütter (born 1946, Krefeld, Germany) and Florian Schneider (born 1947, Düsseldorf, Germany) met while they were studying improvised music in Düsseldorf, Germany. In 1967 Ralf Hütter (organ), Florian Schneider (violin, flute), Basil Hammoudi (vocals), Butch Hauf (bass) and Fred Monics (drums) formed the group Organisation, released the album Tone Float and split shortly thereafter. The album features repetitive percussion and bass drum patterns embellished with guitar, flute, violin and organ. \n\nAfter disbanding Organisation, Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider adopted the name Kraftwerk. Early Kraftwerk line-ups from 1970–1974 fluctuated, as Hütter and Schneider worked with around a half-dozen other musicians, most notably Andreas Hohmann (drums; 1970), Houschäng Néjadepour (guitar; 1970), Charly Weiss (drums; 1970/71), Eberhard Kranemann (cello, bass, hawaii-guitar; 1970/71), Klaus Röder (electric guitar, electronic violin; 1974), Michael Rother (guitar; 1970-71) and Klaus Dinger (drums; 1970-71). For a short period in 1970/71 Ralf Hütter left the band to complete his degree in architecture. There were some sessions/concerts with the line-up \"Schneider, Kranemann, Weiss\",  \"Schneider, Hohmann, Kranemann, Rother, Dinger\" and \"Schneider, Rother, Dinger\" in that time.  In 1971 Rother and Dinger left Kraftwerk to form the band Neu!.\n\nTheir first three albums were more free-form experimental rock without the pop hooks or the more disciplined strong structure of its later work. Their debut album, Kraftwerk, released in 1970, and Kraftwerk 2, released in 1972, were mostly exploratory jam music, played on a variety of traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, electric organ, flute and violin. Post-production modifications to these recordings were then used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track. Connie Plank co-produced the first four Kraftwerk albums. Emil Schult has also collaborated on many releases, contributing both lyrics and graphics.\n\nLive performances from 1972–73 were made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic drum machine, with preset rhythms taken from an electric organ. These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France. In 1973, Wolfgang Flür (electronic percussion) joined the group.\n\nWith Ralf und Florian, released in 1973, the band began to move closer to its classic sound, relying more heavily on synthesisers and drum machines. Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk's first use of the vocoder, which would, in time, become one of its musical signatures. \n\nIn 1974, they issued the fourth studio album, Autobahn. This critically acclaimed album marked Kraftwerk's breakthrough and established them as purveyors of electronic music. The title track is intended to capture the feeling of driving on the Autobahn: from travelling through the landscape, the high-speed concentration on the fast lane, to tuning the car radio and the monotony of a long trip. An edited version of \"Autobahn\" song reached #25 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and #11 in the UK.\n\nIn 1975, Karl Bartos (electronic percussion, live vibraphone, live keyboards) joined the band. The Hütter-Schneider-Bartos-Flür formation is now regarded as the classic line-up of Kraftwerk, which remained in place until the late 80s.\n\nIn 1975, Kraftwerk released the concept album Radio-Activity (German version: Radio-Aktivität). The hyphenated album title displays Kraftwerk's typical deadpan humour, being a pun on the twin themes of the songs, half being about radioactivity and the other half about activity on the radio. The title track \"Radioactivity\" was released as a single, and became a hit in France after it was used as the theme to a popular music show. This was the first Kraftwerk album to be entirely self-produced by Hütter & Schneider in their Kling Klang studio, and the first one to be performed by the classic line-up of Kraftwerk.\n\nIn 1977, Kraftwerk released the highly influential album, Trans-Europe Express. Critics have described the album as having two specific themes: celebration of Europe and the disparities between reality and image. Musically, the songs on this album differ from the group's earlier Krautrock style with a focus on electronic mechanized rhythms, minimalism, and occasional manipulated vocals. Two singles supported the album: \"Trans-Europe Express\" and \"Showroom Dummies\".\n\nBy the time of 1978's The Man-Machine (German version: Die Mensch-Maschine), Kraftwerk had created their own unmistakable brand of \"robot pop\". NME said of The Man-Machine: 'It is the only completely successful visual/aural fusion rock has produced so far\". Kraftwerk spent three years building their own Kling Klang studios in the late 70s, complete with, inevitably, scores of computers. The single \"The Model\", gave the band a surprise hit when it topped the UK charts in 1982.\n\nIn 1981 Kraftwerk released their eight studio album, Computer World (German version: Computerwelt). This album combined the use of the sequencer to create the sound now known as electro, inspiring the first producers in Detroit in creating techno, as well as innumerable other artists including Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, and New Order, among many others. This album had the theme of computers taking over the world in the future. It was a commercial success, spawning the singles \"Pocket Calculator\", \"Computer World\" and \"Computer Love\". For this album, the band embarked on the massive Computer World world tour.\n\nThe EP Tour De France was issued in 1983. This song was featured in the film Breakdance and became the theme for the cycling event of the same name in that year. In 1986, the ninth studio album Electric Café was released. The album received mixed reviews. Two singles were issued from the album: \"Musique Non-Stop\" and \"The Telephone Call\".\n\nIn 1987 Wolfgang Flür departed and it was replaced by Fritz Hilpert. In 1991, Kraftwerk's best known songs were collected together and re-recorded on the compilation The Mix.\n\nThe single Expo 2000 released in December 1999 came as a surprise for Kraftwerk fans. A brand new song, although low key, sparked hopes of a new album. A video was released for this track, showing the band playing in wireframe suits, but no public appearances or interviews until 2003.\n\nIn 2003 the band released Tour de France Soundtracks, its first album of new material since 1986's Electric Café. The album was recorded for the 100th anniversary of the first Tour de France bicycle race, although it missed its original release date during the actual Tour. A completely new recording was made for the \"Tour De France\" track, based on the original 1983 arrangement.\n\nIn June 2005, Kraftwerk released Minimum-Maximum, their first official live album. It features two CDs and tracks recorded on their world tour during 2004, including concerts in Warsaw, Moscow, Berlin, London, Budapest, Tallinn, Riga, Tokyo and San Francisco. The band also released a live DVD.\n\nFlorian Schneider officially left the band in January 2009, though news of his departure was reported as early as April 2008. His place will be taken over by Stefan Pfaffe. \n\nIn 2009, the band issued The Catalogue (German version: Der Katalog), a box-set comprising eight albums by Kraftwerk that were released from 1974 to 2003. All albums were digitally remastered, with most of the cover art redesigned, including rare photographs in the liner notes that were not part of each album's original release.\n\nKraftwerk's influence has been incalculable. Hundreds of artists today in nearly every electronic music subgenres bear witness to their work. They are also reclusive, rarely giving interviews and making no media appearances.\n\nOfficial site: http://www.kraftwerk.com\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kraftwerk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "David Nesta \"Ziggy\" Marley (born October 17, 1968 in Saint Ann Parish, ghetto of Trenchtown, Jamaica), composer, singer and guitarist, is a multiple Grammy-winning (reggae) Jamaican musician. He is known for songs like \"Tomorrow People\", \"Love Is My Religion\" and \"A Lifetime\", He is the oldest son in the marriage between the singer Rita Anderson (Marley) and late legendary reggae Bob Marley. David's father Bob nicknamed him \"Ziggy\". A ziggy is a big marijuana spliff  on Jamaiaca.\n\nZiggy learned  Rastafari faith from his parents and had access to some of the world's best reggae musicians in the comp band of his father – the legendary reggae Wailers. Ziggy Marley first sat in on recording sessions with Bob Marley and the Wailers when he was around 10 years old. Joining with his three siblings to become The Melody Makers, Ziggy crafted his own soulful sound blending blues, RnB, hip-hop and roots reggae.\n\nAfter their first two albums, Play The Game Right (1985) and Hey World! (1986), The Melody Makers earned their first Grammy (Best Reggae Recording) for Conscious Party (1988), an album produced by Talking Heads Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth which included the hit songs \"Tomorrow People\" and \"Tumbling Down.\"\n\nSubsequent albums included the Grammy-winning One Bright Day (1989), Jamekya (1991), Joy and Blues (1993), Free Like We Want 2 B (1995), their third Grammy winner Fallen is Babylon (1997), Spirit of Music (1999) and Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers Live, Vol 1 (2000), which featured some of their biggest hits as well as a cover of Bob Marley's \"Could You Be Loved.\"\n\nWhile selling records by the millions and selling out countless concerts with the Melody Makers, including a recent European tour, Ziggy Marley has never lost sight of his foundation of faith, fellowship and family.\n\nAfter two decades as the driving creative force behind The Melody Makers, Ziggy stepped out on his own with his first solo album, Dragonfly (2003). Never content to rehash the success of his past, Ziggy uses Dragonfly to explore new ground and create his own distinctive musical identity as a solo artist.\n\n\"Working on my own gave me a chance to take my time and experiment a lot,\" Ziggy says of the material on Dragonfly.\" It took one year to finish this record. It's the longest I've ever worked on a album. It's different when you on your own. At some point it's scary and then at another it's a drive that makes you focus more.\"\n\nAlthough the members of the most close-knit musical families often yearn to step out on their own, for Ziggy, a solo debut was not a long-awaited goal. \"It's not something that I wished for since I began doing music,\" he says. \"It was just the circumstances, and I wanted to be true to myself and what I feel. The record has strong messages and it feels good.\"\n\nIn addition to being Ziggy's first album of solo material, for Dragonfly he felt it was time for a change of scene. \"Usually we record in Kingston. These songs were written in Jamaica and recorded in America. I did the first set of recordings in a house in Miami and then went to L.A. rented a house, set up my equipment and basically did the rest there. I left Jamaica for a while, because as an artist I need to experience different things, to see the world and have different energies. Living in one place is not good for me and I was tired of making music in a studio setting. I wanted it to be more like everyday life a part of me.\n\n\"As an individual, I've opened up more by traveling outside Jamaica, and I've been more able to be open to people and ideas. It helps me to grow as a person to be outside of my element; to be on my own in a strange place meeting people. That's good for me not to be in my secure domain.\"\n\nThe evidence of that growth is everywhere on Dragonfly.\n\nOn July 2nd, 2006, Ziggy released his second album, Love is My Religion. He states \"This album is from my heart,\" and he feels that he embraces his spiritual and emotional side of life. This album show Ziggy coming into his own as an artist, as he wrote all of the songs for the album and played nearly all of the instruments.\n\nLove is My Religion is a testament to Ziggy Marley's talent as he follows in the footsteps of his father, the Legend. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ziggy+Marley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Emerging onto the Southern California music scene with a sound as original as the band members themselves, the Dirty Heads’ blend of hip-hop and classic reggae rips through the sonic surf with bold beats, fun rhythms and the relaxed vibe of feel-good lyrics.\n\nRooted in the Orange County community of Huntington Beach, California, founding band members Jared Watson and guitarist / vocalist Dustin Bushnell met in 1996 while in high school, embarking on a friendship based on music, as well as their shared passion for surfing, skating and the endless party of the laid-back SoCal lifestyle.\n\nEarly on, they spent many late nights jamming in Bushnell’s soundproof garage with a four-track recorder, writing unique acoustic hip-hop songs that featured reggae inflections. Inspired by the rock and reggae sounds of Bob Marley, Sublime, 311 and The Beastie Boys, the band’s music evolved into their distinct Dirty Heads style.\n\nTo complete the Dirty Heads’ sound, the duo added percussionist Jon Olazabal and drummer Matt Ochoa, both talented, experienced musicians. With a set of solid material, the Dirty Heads were further motivated to take their craft to the next level, and they began building a loyal fan base throughout the west coast, while performing acoustically at local bars and small music venues. As they started playing in neighboring Los Angeles, the band found it necessary to charter party buses so their fans could make the 30-mile trek to their shows.\n\nConnecting with sought-after producers Steve Fox and Stan Frazier (Sugar Ray / Ashlee Simpson) the band worked long hours to polish their material and further develop their style. The Dirty Heads also recruited mixing engineer Mario Caldato Jr., best known for his work with the Beastie Boys, to add the finishing touches and create just the right blend.\n\nThe band’s highly-anticipated first full-length album is entitled, Any Port in the Storm (Released on EMG through Fontana, a division of Universal Music Group Distribution - September 2008). This debut features 14 tracks that are reminiscent of the upbeat, sun-soaked Southern California party energy. The first single is the optimistic, “Stand Tall.”\n\nAny Port in the Storm also features one of the final recordings of the late music industry icon Billy Preston. Frequently referred to as “The Fifth Beatle,” Preston played on three tracks, including “Stand Tall,” “Chelsea,” and “Driftin.’ ” Other special guests on the album are drummer Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle, Sting, The Vandals), and veteran session percussionist Alex Acuna, whose A-list musician resume includes Peter Gabriel, Johnny Clegg, and Jackson Browne, to name only a few.\n\nRecently, the band’s music has been attracting attention throughout the world of entertainment. Their songs have been featured in the movie and soundtrack for Surf’s Up (Sony 2007); and the television drama, Shark staring James Woods (CBS 2007. Actor Matthew McConaughey selected the band’s music to be in his upcoming film, Surfer Dude. In addition, the Dirty Heads can be heard in Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam video game (Activision 2007), and several other music compilations and surf/skate videos. On the marketing side, the Dirty Heads have also been included in campaigns for Etnies Jeans and Vestal Watches.\n\nDirty Heads vocalist Jared Watson sums up their fun, uncomplicated style, “We want to be positive and entertain,” he says. “We just want to make you feel good.”\n\nAnd who can’t dig that?\n\nwww.dirtyheads.com\nwww.myspace.com/dirtyheads <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dirty+Heads\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Big Head Todd & the Monsters is a rock band formed in 1986 in Colorado. The band has released eight studio albums since 1989 with their 1993 album Sister Sweetly going well beyond platinum in the US. The band has developed a sizeable live following especially in the Mountain States of the US. \n Big Head Todd and The Monsters – singer-guitarist Todd Park Mohr, bassist-singer Rob Squires, drummer-singer Brian Nevin and keyboardist-guitarist-singer Jeremy Lawton --  could have begun resting on their laurels back in 1993, when their Top 10 singles “Bittersweet,” “Broken Hearted Savior,” “Circle” and “It’s Alright” pushed the album Sister Sweetly to platinum certification. However, Mohr says, “I’ve fought throughout our career not to be a one-trick pony, to be the kind of band that has depth and diversity in its catalogue. I’m a fan of this band, and I’m constantly looking forward to what comes next.”\nThe essence of Big Head Todd and The Monsters – a rootsy, emotionally direct variety of rock ’n’ roll that lends itself particularly well to a live setting – has been winning fans since Mohr, Rob Squires and Brian Nevin started playing together in high school (Jeremy Lawton joined in 2004). Needless to say, the three never expected to be in the same band at this late date, but, as Mohr points out, “It was a really fortunate combination of musical personalities, and we’re still partners in every sense of the word.”\nThe band spent seven years developing their chemistry and amassing a following, boosted significantly by the independent releases Another Mayberry (1989) and Midnight Radio (1990), before being “discovered” by the listening public at large with 1993’s Sister Sweetly. After a major-label stint (Sister Sweetly, 1994’s Stratagem, 1997’s Beautiful World), during which the trio increasingly found itself frustrated artistically, they reclaimed their independent status (2001’s Riviera, 2004’s Crimes of Passion). “If it were not for our ability to do things for ourselves, we would have disappeared a long time ago,” Mohr allows.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Head+Todd+and+the+Monsters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Tyler Okonma (born March 6, 1991) is Tyler, The Creator, an American rapper, record producer, director, fashion designer, and the head of his own independent record label, Odd Future Records. He is the leader of Los Angeles, California, USA hip-hop collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All (OFWGKTA). Since his first recordings debuted on The Odd Future Tape in 2007, he has rapped on, and produced for, nearly every OFWGKTA release. \n\nTyler, The Creator is Okonma's most commonly used alias, and the one that both of his first two albums are credited to, but he has used several others as well, including Wolf Haley, Ace (or Ace Creator), and Young Nigga, the latter of which was part of a prank on OFWGKTA's official site.  In addition, several other characters or alter egos portrayed by Tyler are featured in his music, such as Tron Cat and a therapist called Dr. TC.\n\nIn 2009, Tyler self-released his debut solo album Bastard as a free download off of the official OFWGKTA website.  Two music videos were released for tracks off of Bastard, \"VCR\" and \"French!,\" both of which were directed by Tyler (credited as Wolf Haley).  The album is focused around dialogues between Tyler and Dr. TC, and it received generally positive reviews from critics and blogs alike.\n\nAfter signing to XL Recordings in February 2011, he released \"Yonkers,\" the lead single off his sophomoric album Goblin, which was released on May 10, 2011. The music video for \"Yonkers\" (directed by Tyler credited as Wolf Haley) won Tyler the 2011 MTV Video Music Award for \"Best New Artist,\" as well as a nomination for Video of the Year (which lost to Katy Perry's \"Firework\").  \n\nGoblin, an album described as \"dark,\" \"monolithic,\" and \"a natural sequel to Bastard,\" continues the sessions with Tyler's fictional therapist, with Tyler venting to Dr. TC about fame, message boards, critics, hype, expectations, media scrutiny, and the idea of being a role model.  All of the production was handled by Tyler, save for \"Transylvania,\" which was produced by fellow OFWGKTA member Left Brain.\n\nTyler's third studio album, known as Wolf, was initially scheduled to be released sometime in 2012.  Tyler alluded to several possible track names on his Formspring account, and he stated that the album would focus less on rapping and more on production.  In an interview with DJ Semtex, he confirmed that he wouldhandle all the production on the album, except one song produced by Left Brain, the same approach that was used for Goblin.  On February 14, 2013, OFWGKTA uploaded a video to their YouTube account, which included L-Boy skydiving and stating that Wolf would be released on April 2, 2013. The same day Tyler revealed three album covers via his Instagram. The first single from the album was released on February 14, 2013, titled \" Domo 23\" along with the music video which features cameos from Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Jasper Dolphin and Taco Bennett. On February 26, 2013, Tyler performed the songs \"Domo23\" and \"Treehome95\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tyler,+the+Creator\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Peter Frampton (born 22 April 1950 in Beckenham, Kent) is a British musician, best known today for his multi-platinum selling solo work in the mid-70s when he was  an \"arena rocker\". He originally became famous, however, as a young member of psychedelic era band The Herd and became a teen idol in Britain. Steve Marriott reportedly wanted to bring the 18-year-old Frampton into the Small Faces lineup but ended up starting Humble Pie with Frampton instead.  After touring the US and Europe for two years, he left Humble Pie as the group was gaining popularity because of disdain for Marriott's hard living lifestyle and screaming  boogie rock direction. Aside from his work with Humble Pie, other recordings of this era that feature Frampton include albums by Harry Nilsson, Jerry Lee Lewis, and George Harrison. His solo debut was 1972's Wind of Change, which did not fare well on the charts though receiving critical praise. It also featured appearances by musicians such as Ringo Starr and Mick Jones.  Two more efforts by Frampton also struggled commercially, one released under the moniker Frampton's Camel. Constant touring began to create awareness of his talents, however, and 1974's Frampton LP went gold. It also peaked  #32 on the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S., showing his growing international appeal.  He finally gained lasting international fame by 1976 when his much-loved live album, Frampton Comes Alive! was released. Having built up his reputation on the road, the LP debuted at No. 1 on the charts in January 1976. It was long considered the best-selling live album of all time, moving over 16 million copies worldwide.   In 1978, Peter suffered a near fatal car crash in the Bahamas, which left him with a concussion, muscle damage and broken bones. But in 1979, he released the album 'Where I Should Be', which went gold and produced the hit 'I Can't Stand It No More'.  His extensive use of the Talk Box effect was and still is an integral part of the Peter Frampton experience.  His albums never regained the high chart placements of the 70's era but he has continued his musical career none the less. Among the gimmicks he's employed to maintain interest have been releasing Frampton Comes Alive II, as well as joining Ringo Starr's touring revue, recording two CDs with ex-Stone Bill Wyman and unsucessfully attempting to reunite with Steve Marriott before his death in 1991. Other notable occasions include starring with the Bee Gees in a film version of The Beatles Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album and playing with David Bowie on his Never Let Me Down album and tour.  In 2006, Frampton released Fingerprints, a completely instrumental guitar showcase album.   Peter now resides in Cincinnati, Ohio and can still be found playing concerts around the world.     <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Frampton\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Two brothers, Seth Avett and Scott Avett, formed the group in 2000 after the breakup of the former rock band, Nemo, adding a third member, Bob Crawford. Subsequently, they have been joined by cellist Joe Kwon. The Avett Brothers combine old-time country, bluegrass, punk, pop melodies, folk, rock and roll, honky tonk and ragtime to produce a sound described by the Washington Post as \"post civil-war modern rock\", or by other reviewers as \"grungegrass\". For a long time the group eschewed labels, feeling that \"none would do the music justice.\" Ironically, the Avetts signed to Columbia Records on Independence Day 2008 to record their fifth album with acclaimed producer Rick Rubin. It's simply left up to each person to extract his or her own account from the Avetts' music.\"\n\nTheir live performances, generally at smaller venues, showcase their use of three-part harmony and southern rock feel, and are admired for being intense, energetic, and soulful. The Avetts have been picking up steam opening for Dave Matthews Band and playing SXSW and Newport Folk Festival.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Almost out of nowhere, Los Angeles’ Dillon Francis has broken from the throng of young electronic music dj/producers. With a stream of world-class remixes and releases, Dillon has caught the attention of some of the top players in club land, including Steve Aoki, Diplo, Will I. Am, Drop The Lime, Sinden, and Tittsworth, to name some. In less than a year his blistering productions have been heavily supported by Major Lazer, who opened their show with “Westside!,” a Dutch House-flavored monster that was consistently rinsed by top djs on both sides of the pond, including Sinden and Steve Aoki. The tune is finally seeing a proper release on Diplo’s Mad Decent label, where Dillon will be releasing his “Masta Blasta” EP as well in the near future.. From his first dubstep release on Play Me Records, the heavy “Take Me High” peaked at No. 13 on the Beatport dubstep chart and was played in full by Rusko in every one of his sets for his current OMG tour. In the coming months, Dillon will have releases on Mad Decent, Dim Mak, Top Billin’, as well as Plant Music, where he will be releasing his next club EP. At ease behind the turntables and in the studio, in the electro world and in dubstep, Dillon is what you would call an open-format electronic dj who sees no delineation between making music and playing it. He has gotten huge support from the most important dance music blogs (Dim Mak, Mad Decent, Discobelle, Gotta Dance Dirty) ever since releasing his first bootlegs last year, and 2011 promises to be Dillon’s breakout year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dillon+Francis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "While it’s a rare commodity for a band to tour as consistently as Slightly Stoopid, the group’s diligent commitment to live music provides some insight into their loyal fan base and unique creative metamorphosis throughout their 17-year existence. Though it's been a couple of years since the release of their last studio album, Top Of The World (August 14, 2012), the Ocean Beach, California-based group—led by co-founders and multi-instrumentalists Kyle McDonald and Miles Doughty—have also found the same passionate dedication to their studio craft, holing up between tours in their own San Diego recording studio and record label complex. The balance of a prolific touring regimen between albums have helped to refine the tasty fusion and massive groove that permeates Stoopid’s trademark sound and seven album catalogue, as well as their live shows.\n\n\"We're a touring act, and we've been on the road pretty much non-stop over the last decade,\" explains Doughty, offering that the more recent creation of the band's own local recording studio and rehearsal clubhouse (within the warehouse district of Mission Valley just inland of Ocean Beach) certainly aided and influenced their last release Top of the World, and has inspired their latest sessions, which the band anticipates could stretch into a few different recording projects.\n\n\"Over the last 3 years we started our own studio and within the last 9 months, anticipating the window for new album sessions, the band has invested into innovations and equipment upgrades for the studio in a quest to capture and progress our signature sound forward. Having our own studio really enables us to make records at our own pace and to make the right records, hopefully (with a grin) at various stages of our career,” Doughty continues. “What's nice about having our own environment to record in and analyze the music is it really lets you keep an organic feel. For us, I feel like it's a step into the next level, as far as understanding the process of recording, understanding the process of songwriting. We took everything that we've learned over the years and really put it into this place and into our music.” The property also houses the creative loft space that has become the official offices of the band’s own label Stoopid Records, which issued the band’s second album in 1999 Acoustic Roots, and has continued to be their preferred method of distributing the band’s recorded material.\n\nAnother key ingredient to what makes Slightly Stoopid extraordinarily special is the inclusion of several musical guests, both live and in the studio. \"It really keeps that 'family atmosphere' for us,” says Doughty. “I think it really shows in the music — we live for the spirit of collaboration and on Top of The World we had G. Love, Angelo Moore from Fishbone, Don Carlos, Barrington Levy, Ian Neville from Dumpstaphunk, Tory Ruffin from Morris Day and the Time and Fishbone, and singer/songwriter Angela Hunte. Angelo Moore to me is one of the greatest front-men to ever step foot on a stage. As a fan and out of respect, I try to do something with Angelo every time we have a record, really. If you listen to his lyrics, his vocal performance—I don't know who could keep up with Angelo on stage. Don Carlos from Black Uhuru is one of the legendary reggae singers of all time and we've had the pleasure of working with him the last few years. We've been friends with G. Love for over 15 years, and we've been able to work together quite a few different times in the studio. It seems like second nature. Whenever you're recording with G., it's almost like you're really just hanging out with your bro and you happen to hit record. We've done so many shows together and so many studio sessions, it becomes second nature.“ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Slightly+Stoopid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Joe Bonamassa (born Joseph Leonard Bonamassa on May 8, 1977) is an American blues rock guitarist, singer and songwriter.  Songfacts states that Bonamassa was born and raised in New Hartford, New York. His parents owned and ran a guitar shop and in interviews he credits his mother and father with fostering an appreciation of music in his life as early as he can remember.  As a youngster he just wanted to earn enough money to buy a deluxe Nintendo game when he started playing the guitar professionally. Then he met blues legend B.B. King. At the age of 12, his mother got a call from a local promoter, Richard Thornton asking if he wanted to be the opening act at a concert at which King was the headliner. After hearing the gifted adolescent play, King was so impressed that he invited Bonamassa to tour over the summer with his band.  The gig got Bonamassa exposure on national television and a recording contract with EMI Records. He has made seven studio albums and spends nine months a year on the road performing with industry greats that include John Lee Hooker, Joe Cocker, Peter Frampton, George Thorogood, Los Lobos and Jonny Lang.  Bonamassa has cited his influences as being British and Irish blues acts, rather than American acts. In an interview in Guitarist magazine (issue 265), he cited the three albums that had the biggest influence on his playing:  John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers'  Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (the Beano album), Rory Gallagher's  Irish Tour and  Goodbye by Cream.  He elaborated further on his influences in his review with Guitar Messanger:  \"You know, my heroes were the English guys – Paul Kossoff, Peter Green, Eric Clapton. There’s so many - there’s Gary Moore, Rory Gallagher – another Irishman who played the same things, but don’t tell him that. But those guys were my guys – Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page. There’s a certain sophistication to their approach to the blues that I really like, more so than the American blues that I was listening to. B.B. King’s a big influence – he’s probably my biggest traditional influence. I love Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and T-Bone Walker and stuff like that, but I couldn’t sit down… I was always forcing myself to listen to whole records by them, where I’d rather listen to Humble Pie do \"I'm Ready\" than Muddy Waters, you know? I think, the English interpretation of the blues just hit me a lot better, you know?\"  And also in his October 2008 interview with Express & Star:  “When I heard Kossoff playing Mr Big and when I heard Clapton playing Crossroads and when I heard Rory Gallagher playing Cradle Rock, I was like ‘This is way cooler’.... “British blues are my thing. When I heard Rod Stewart and the Jeff Beck Group singing Let Me Love You it changed my life. I knew exactly what I wanted to do. Those are my influences\".

    "headlinerBio": "The Avett Brothers are a non-traditional bluegrass band that originated in Concord, North Carolina. The two brothers, Seth Avett and Scott Avett, formed the group in 2000 after the breakup of the former rock band, Nemo, adding a third member, Bob Crawford. More recently, they have been joined by cellist Joe Kwon. The Avett Brothers combine old-time country, bluegrass, punk, pop melodies, folk, rock and roll, honky tonk and ragtime to produce a sound described by the Washington Post as \"post civil-war modern rock\", or by other reviewers as \"grungegrass\". For a long time the group eschewed labels, feeling that \"none would do the music justice.\" Ironically, the Avetts signed to Columbia Records on Independence Day 2008 to record their fifth album with acclaimed producer Rick Rubin. It's simply left up to each person to extract his or her own account from the Avetts' music.\"  Their live performances, generally at smaller venues, showcase their use of three-part harmony and southern rock feel, and are admired for being intense, energetic, and soulful. The Avetts have been picking up steam opening for Dave Matthews Band and playing SXSW and Newport Folk Festival.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.\n\nThe band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek & Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.\n\nAfter the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.\n\nThe collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track \"Space Captain\" with additional members of Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks & Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform \"Space Captain\" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nOn 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.\n\nSites: Discogs, YouTube and Facebook <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tedeschi+Trucks+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Emerging onto the Southern California music scene with a sound as original as the band members themselves, the Dirty Heads’ blend of hip-hop and classic reggae rips through the sonic surf with bold beats, fun rhythms and the relaxed vibe of feel-good lyrics.\n\nRooted in the Orange County community of Huntington Beach, California, founding band members Jared Watson and guitarist / vocalist Dustin Bushnell met in 1996 while in high school, embarking on a friendship based on music, as well as their shared passion for surfing, skating and the endless party of the laid-back SoCal lifestyle.\n\nEarly on, they spent many late nights jamming in Bushnell’s soundproof garage with a four-track recorder, writing unique acoustic hip-hop songs that featured reggae inflections. Inspired by the rock and reggae sounds of Bob Marley, Sublime, 311 and The Beastie Boys, the band’s music evolved into their distinct Dirty Heads style.\n\nTo complete the Dirty Heads’ sound, the duo added percussionist Jon Olazabal and drummer Matt Ochoa, both talented, experienced musicians. With a set of solid material, the Dirty Heads were further motivated to take their craft to the next level, and they began building a loyal fan base throughout the west coast, while performing acoustically at local bars and small music venues. As they started playing in neighboring Los Angeles, the band found it necessary to charter party buses so their fans could make the 30-mile trek to their shows.\n\nConnecting with sought-after producers Steve Fox and Stan Frazier (Sugar Ray / Ashlee Simpson) the band worked long hours to polish their material and further develop their style. The Dirty Heads also recruited mixing engineer Mario Caldato Jr., best known for his work with the Beastie Boys, to add the finishing touches and create just the right blend.\n\nThe band’s highly-anticipated first full-length album is entitled, Any Port in the Storm (Released on EMG through Fontana, a division of Universal Music Group Distribution - September 2008). This debut features 14 tracks that are reminiscent of the upbeat, sun-soaked Southern California party energy. The first single is the optimistic, “Stand Tall.”\n\nAny Port in the Storm also features one of the final recordings of the late music industry icon Billy Preston. Frequently referred to as “The Fifth Beatle,” Preston played on three tracks, including “Stand Tall,” “Chelsea,” and “Driftin.’ ” Other special guests on the album are drummer Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle, Sting, The Vandals), and veteran session percussionist Alex Acuna, whose A-list musician resume includes Peter Gabriel, Johnny Clegg, and Jackson Browne, to name only a few.\n\nRecently, the band’s music has been attracting attention throughout the world of entertainment. Their songs have been featured in the movie and soundtrack for Surf’s Up (Sony 2007); and the television drama, Shark staring James Woods (CBS 2007. Actor Matthew McConaughey selected the band’s music to be in his upcoming film, Surfer Dude. In addition, the Dirty Heads can be heard in Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam video game (Activision 2007), and several other music compilations and surf/skate videos. On the marketing side, the Dirty Heads have also been included in campaigns for Etnies Jeans and Vestal Watches.\n\nDirty Heads vocalist Jared Watson sums up their fun, uncomplicated style, “We want to be positive and entertain,” he says. “We just want to make you feel good.”\n\nAnd who can’t dig that?\n\nwww.dirtyheads.com\nwww.myspace.com/dirtyheads <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dirty+Heads\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Christopher Dwayne Tomlin (born May 4, 1972) is a Christian worship leader/CCM artist originally from Grand Saline, Texas. In 1999, Tomlin rose to recognition  joined on board as a worship leader for Atlanta pastor Louie Giglio’s annual Passion Conferences, along with other worship leaders such as Matt Redman, Charlie Hall, and eventually with Christy Nockels, Kristian Stanfill, and the David Crowder Band (now Crowder). Tomlin  was soon signed to Sparrow Records and EMI's sixstepsrecords where he began releasing his worship albums.  In 2008, after five solo album releases, and nine with Passion, Tomlin made the move from Texas to Atlanta to be a worship leader for Giglio’s new church, Passion City Church, with its first service being held in February of 2009. Tomlin has since released four solo worship albums, two Christmas albums, and one live album.  In 2013, Tomlin’s seventh album Burning Light debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart, becoming only the fourth album by a Christian artist to top that chart, along with Butterfly Kisses (Shades of Grace) by Bob Carlisle, You Light Up My Life by LeeAnn Rimes, both in 1997, and TobyMac's Eye On It in 2012.  Tomlin has recorded some of the most famous songs ever in Christian music, such as How Great Is Our God, Holy Is The Lord, Our God, and Whom Shall I Fear (God of Angel Armies)  Throughout his successful career, Tomlin has won 22 GMA Dove Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, and a Grammy.

    "headlinerBio": "Alfred Matthew \"Weird Al\" Yankovic (born October 23, 1959 in Downey, California) is an American singer-songwriter, music producer, actor, comedian, satirist, accordion player and kazooist. Yankovic is known in particular for his humorous songs that make light of popular culture and that often parody specific songs by contemporary musical acts. Since his first-aired song parody in 1976, he has sold more than 12 million albums—more than any other comedy act in history—recorded more than 150 parody and original songs, and has performed more than 1,000 live shows.His works have earned him three Grammy Awards among nine nominations, four gold records, and six platinum records in the United States. Yankovic's first top ten Billboard album (Straight Outta Lynwood) and single (\"White & Nerdy\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career.  In addition to recording his albums, Yankovic has written and starred in his own film, UHF, and his own television show, The Weird Al Show, and directed music videos for himself and other artists including Ben Folds, Hanson, the Black Crowes and The Presidents of the United States of America. He has also made guest appearances on many television shows, in addition to starring in his own Al TV specials.  Though parodies earned him his fame, Yankovic has recorded a greater number of humorous songs with original tunes. Some of these pieces are pastiches (or style parodies), where he chooses a band's entire body of work to emulate rather than any single hit, although Yankovic has many completely original pieces. Most of his albums include a medley which juxtaposes the choruses of various songs in a polka style to accordion music.  Due to his popularity, he has been credited with several songs that are not actually his. A full list of every song he has ever actually done, including the live-only songs, can be found at the Al Songs website.  Similarly, a comprehensive list of songs incorrectly credited to him can be found at The Not Al Page.  In 2006, Al recorded the song \"You're Pitiful\". However, while James Blunt gave his blessing for the parody of his song, \"You're Beautiful\", Blunt's label Atlantic Records was opposed to it. Though parodies are protected legally, the issue had become \"more of a political matter than a legal matter\", according to Al, so he decided to not put the song on his next album. Instead, he offered it as a free download from his site.  His latest album, \"Straight Outta Lynwood\", was released September 26th, 2006. Its first released single, \"Don't Download This Song\", was made available as a free download on August 21, 2006. The animated video for the track and a link to downloadable MP3 is available at dontdownloadthissong.com. Among other tracks, the album includes parodies of Green Day, Usher, R. Kelly, and Chamillionaire. Chamillionaire's \"Ridin' Dirty\" is parodied as \"White and Nerdy\", the second released single from the new album.  This single has thus far climbed as far as #9 on the Billboard Singles chart, eclipsing \"Eat It\" as Al's highest charting single (which went as high as #12).

    "headlinerBio": "My Morning Jacket is a rock band which formed in 1998 in Louisville, Kentucky, United States. The band consists of Jim James (vocals, guitar), Carl Broemel (guitar), \"Two Tone\" Tommy Blankenship (bass), Bo Koster (keyboards) and Patrick Hallahan (drums). The band is best known for their reverb-soaked sound and their enthusiastic live shows. My Morning Jacket is signed with ATO Records. The band's style is a blend of alternative, alt country, folk rock and psychedelic rock.  The band's moniker comes from a discarded coat James saw while walking through the remains of his favorite bar the morning after it burned down. The coat had the letters \"MMJ\" embroided on it. The band has released seven albums so far:  \"The Tennessee Fire\" (1999), \"At Dawn\" (2001), \"It Still Moves\" (2003), \"Z\" (2005), \"Evil Urges\" (2008), \"Circuital\" (2011) & \"The Waterfall\" (2015). The band's breakthrough came when their 2003 single \"One Big Holiday\" became one of the most played songs on college radio that year.  2008's \"I'm Amazed\" was also a sizable hit, peaking at #6 on Billboard's Triple A (adult album alternative) Singles chart.   The Circuital songfacts reports that \"Circuital\" was recorded inside a church’s converted gymnasium in the band's hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. Said frontman Jim James: “I hate the phrase ‘going back to our roots’, but for this record we came home and made it in Kentucky. And it just felt a lot like it did when we were first starting out.”  James co-produced the record with Tucker Martine. The pair first worked together when James appeared on Laura Veirs ' album \"July Flame\" in 2010, which Martine, Veirs’ husband, also produced.   My Morning Jacket guest stared in the American Dad Episode \"My Morning Straitjacket\" where Stan Smith becomes obsessed with them and decides to become a groupie.

    "headlinerBio": "\nLord Huron is an American indie band founded by Ben Schneider, a Michigan-born visual arts major. \n\nOrigins\nIn the spring of 2010 Schneider traveled from Los Angeles to Northern Michigan. At Lake Huron, he developed songs for the first Lord Huron EP. He named the recording, Into the Sun. Upon his return to L.A., Schneider set to work putting a band together. The first to join him was his percussion-playing childhood friend Mark. Each of the band members of band hail from Michigan.\n\nInto The Sun and Mighty\nLord Huron released two EPs in 2010, Into the Sun and Mighty. Pop & Hiss, the LA Times Music Blog, described Mighty as \"full of lush acoustic guitars and Midwestern-accented harmonies as warm as a winter fireplace, but it's the Caribbean-influenced percussion that fans Lord Huron's folk sound into flame,\"and Pitchfork could only classify it as \"a stylistic superball, bouncing off any wall you put around it.\" NPR's World Cafe wrote \"the band's lush harmonies are backed by a hazy whirlpool of polyrhythmic tropical drums and folk guitars.\"\nDespite the fact that Schneider played all of the instruments on both EPs, he has gathered a band for live performances, which have also gotten positive reviews. \"The totality of the experience was like being on hand for a combination drum circle, chamber performance, and Calypso street party,\" wrote LA Weekly.Some of the larger shows the band has performed at include Lollapalooza (2011) and Outside Lands (2011), as well as a marathon ten shows in four days at the SXSW (2011) music festival.\n\nDiscography\n\nEPs\nInto The Sun (2010)\nMighty (2010)\nTime to Run (2012)\n\nLPs\nLonesome Dreams (2012)\nStrange Trails (2015)\nVide Noir (2018)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lord+Huron\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": " Stevie Wonder is the stage name of Stevland Hardaway Morris (b. Stevland Hardaway Judkins, 13 May 1950 in Saginaw, MI, USA - a.k.a. Little Stevie Wonder), a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer and activist.  He débuted, as Little Stevie Wonder, with the single \"I Call It Pretty Music, But the Old People Call It the Blues\" (1961, Tamla Motown) and his latest album is \"A Time 2 Love\" (Oct 2005, Motown)  Stevland lost his eyesight shortly after birth. When he was four, his mother left his father, and moved with the children to Detroit.  She changed her name back to Lula Hardaway and later changed her son's surname to Morris, partly for family reasons. Stevland Morris has remained Stevie Wonder's legal name ever since.  Wonder signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of eleven, and continues to perform and record for Motown to this day. Altogether, he has released more than thirty U.S. Top 10 hits and received twenty-two Grammy Awards, the most ever awarded to a male solo artist. In 2008, Billboard magazine placed Wonder fifth in their list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists. He has recorded numerous critically and commercially successful albums, as well as hit singles. Since the mid-1960s, he has written and produced songs for some of his labelmates (such as Smokey Robinson and the Miracles and The Spinners), as well as outside artists like Michael Jackson. A multi-instrumentalist, Wonder plays drums, guitar, synthesizers, congas, and most famously the piano, harmonica, and keyboards.   Wonder forged his divergent styles into a trademark sound, putting his musical signature on a quartet of albums that would change music forever: 1972's Talking Book, 1973's Innervisions, 1974's Fullfillingness' First Finale, and 1976's Songs in the Key of Life. By the end of the decade, Wonder had won a record fifteen Grammys, as well as numerous other awards.  In the following decades he wrote, among other classics, his 1982 collaboration with Paul McCartney, \"Ebony and Ivory,\" which remained number one for seven weeks in a row. 1984's The Woman in Red soundtrack produced the enduring classic \"I Just Called to Say I Love You,\" yet another number-one hit that gained him an Academy Award.  In 1989 Wonder was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside The Rolling Stones.   His contribution to worldwide social and political change is just as impressive. He championed the effort to make Martin Luther King's birthday a national holiday, as well as becoming a driving force behind 1985's USA for Africa campaign, and being visible in U.S. musicians' fight against apartheid in South Africa.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This Alison didn't fall down anything; she jumped head first down the rabbit hole and landed straight on the decks. Armed with turntables, a killer vibe and an open mind, Alison turns countless dance floors across Australia into your favourite kind of Wonderland: more beats, less croquet.  Beginning with a background in indie and classical, Wonderland's best card is her eclecticism. Throughout her youth she toured Europe as a principal cellist for the Sydney Youth Orchestra and later played bass in a successful local indie band.  After inking a global deal with EMI, Wonderland released her debut compilation record - \"Welcome To Wonderland\" mid 2012, while her much anticipated first original's album is due out very soon! If the success of her remixes is anything to go by the record is set to be a game changer.  Wonderland has performed in LA at the official Grammy's Afterparty, all throughout Ibiza on top of MOS and the Brit Awards Afterparty in London. In Australia she has torn up main stages at Splendour in the Grass, Falls Festival, Southbound Festival, Stereosonic, Field Day, Parklife (nationally), Good Vibrations Festival, Harbourlife, Sydney Fashion Week, Future Music Festival, Coaster Festival, Secret Garden Festival and more, not to mention her sellout headline national tours.  The end of 2012 saw Wonderland taking the highly prestigious summer festival time slots. Playing main stage at Falls Festival in a headline slot after Hot Chip to a capacity crowd, Supporting PNAU Live at Wonderland Festival in Perth & again destroying the headline time slot after SBTRKT to a heaving tent at Southbound Festival this all within 1 WEEK!  Wonderland is the party, rumour has it she never sleeps and is reasonably good friends with Oprah. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alison+Wonderland\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The Avett Brothers are a non-traditional bluegrass band that originated in Concord, North Carolina. The two brothers, Seth Avett and Scott Avett, formed the group in 2000 after the breakup of the former rock band, Nemo, adding a third member, Bob Crawford. More recently, they have been joined by cellist Joe Kwon. The Avett Brothers combine old-time country, bluegrass, punk, pop melodies, folk, rock and roll, honky tonk and ragtime to produce a sound described by the Washington Post as \"post civil-war modern rock\", or by other reviewers as \"grungegrass\". For a long time the group eschewed labels, feeling that \"none would do the music justice.\" Ironically, the Avetts signed to Columbia Records on Independence Day 2008 to record their fifth album with acclaimed producer Rick Rubin. It's simply left up to each person to extract his or her own account from the Avetts' music.\"  Their live performances, generally at smaller venues, showcase their use of three-part harmony and southern rock feel, and are admired for being intense, energetic, and soulful. The Avetts have been picking up steam opening for Dave Matthews Band and playing SXSW and Newport Folk Festival.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Joe Bonamassa (born Joseph Leonard Bonamassa on May 8, 1977) is an American blues rock guitarist, singer and songwriter.\n\nSongfacts states that Bonamassa was born and raised in New Hartford, New York. His parents owned and ran a guitar shop and in interviews he credits his mother and father with fostering an appreciation of music in his life as early as he can remember.  As a youngster he just wanted to earn enough money to buy a deluxe Nintendo game when he started playing the guitar professionally. Then he met blues legend B.B. King. At the age of 12, his mother got a call from a local promoter, Richard Thornton asking if he wanted to be the opening act at a concert at which King was the headliner. After hearing the gifted adolescent play, King was so impressed that he invited Bonamassa to tour over the summer with his band.\n\nThe gig got Bonamassa exposure on national television and a recording contract with EMI Records. He has made seven studio albums and spends nine months a year on the road performing with industry greats that include John Lee Hooker, Joe Cocker, Peter Frampton, George Thorogood, Los Lobos and Jonny Lang.\n\nBonamassa has cited his influences as being British and Irish blues acts, rather than American acts. In an interview in Guitarist magazine (issue 265), he cited the three albums that had the biggest influence on his playing:  John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers'  Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (the Beano album), Rory Gallagher's  Irish Tour and  Goodbye by Cream.\n\nHe elaborated further on his influences in his review with Guitar Messanger:\n\n\"You know, my heroes were the English guys – Paul Kossoff, Peter Green, Eric Clapton. There’s so many - there’s Gary Moore, Rory Gallagher – another Irishman who played the same things, but don’t tell him that. But those guys were my guys – Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page. There’s a certain sophistication to their approach to the blues that I really like, more so than the American blues that I was listening to. B.B. King’s a big influence – he’s probably my biggest traditional influence. I love Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and T-Bone Walker and stuff like that, but I couldn’t sit down… I was always forcing myself to listen to whole records by them, where I’d rather listen to Humble Pie do \"I'm Ready\" than Muddy Waters, you know? I think, the English interpretation of the blues just hit me a lot better, you know?\"\n\nAnd also in his October 2008 interview with Express & Star:\n\n“When I heard Kossoff playing Mr Big and when I heard Clapton playing Crossroads and when I heard Rory Gallagher playing Cradle Rock, I was like ‘This is way cooler’.... “British blues are my thing. When I heard Rod Stewart and the Jeff Beck Group singing Let Me Love You it changed my life. I knew exactly what I wanted to do. Those are my influences\".\n\nBonamassa's website is at  http://www.jbonamassa.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Bonamassa\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They had several hits such as Easy, Three Times A Lady, and probably the Commodores' most famous hit, Brick House. \n\nRichie quit the band in 1981 for a solo career. He released his self-titled debut in 1982. The album hit No. 3 on the charts and sold over 4 million copies. His follow up album, Can't Slow Down, sold over twice as many copies and won the Grammy for Album of the Year in '84. His third album, '86's Dancing on the Ceiling spawned such hits as Say You, Say Me, Dancing on the Ceiling, and Se La, but would be the end of his commercial success. \n\nHis 90's albums such as Back to Front, Louder Than Words, and Time all failed to achieve the previous decade's commercial success.

    "headlinerBio": "Lindsey Stirling (born in September, 21, 1986 in Santa Ana, California, United States) is a violinist, dancer and composer based in Utah. A former member of the rock band Stomp on Melvin, Stirling began releasing videos on Youtube in 2007 and in 2010 competed on \"America's Got Talent\". Her appearance on \"America's Got Talent\" gained the attention of cinematographer Devin Graham, with whom she has collaborated on several videos since 2010. Her YouTube channel has become extremely popular and has received upwards of 100 million views.\n\nStirling was born in Santa Ana, California, but spent a portion of her childhood in Gilbert, Arizona and graduated from Mesquite High School. She moved to Provo, Utah to attend Brigham Young University to study recreational therapy. She went on to perform missionary work in New York City for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Stirling returned home to Provo in 2009 to continue studying at BYU. She resided there until December 2012, when she moved back to Arizona with her family. Currently she lives in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAt the age of five, after being influenced by the classical music records played by her father, Stirling began to study the violin. She took private lessons for twelve years. When she was sixteen, she joined a rock band in Mesquite High School with four friends called \"Stomp on Melvin\". As part of her experience with Stomp on Melvin, Stirling wrote a solo violin rock song, and her performance helped her to win the state title of Arizona's Junior Miss and claim the Spirit Award in the America's Junior Miss Finals competition. Stirling was also a member of Charley Jenkins Band for about a year.\n\nStirling has released one EP, \"Lindsey Stomp\" in 2010, along with several singles, including collaborations with Peter Hollens, Eppic and Megan Nicole. Her debut full-length self-titled album \"Lindsey Stirling\" was released 18th September 2012. In December 2012, YouTube announced that Stirling's song, \"Crystallize\", was the No. 8 top-viewed video of 2012 with over 42 million views.\n\nOn March 12, 2014, Stirling posted a video announcing her second studio album, Shatter Me, would be released in May. She also created a PledgeMusic account where consumers could buy her new album, signed or not, and also exclusive items, such as signed posters, personalized video and even Skype calls with Stirling herself. At the end of the first day, the signed Shatter Me CD was already sold out. On March 25, 2014, Stirling officially released her first single from Shatter Me, entitled \"Beyond the Veil\", along with its accompanying music video. Their second album Shatter Me was released on April 29, 2014. It is Stirling's first album to include collaborations with other vocalists, featuring Lzzy Hale (from Halestorm) and Dia Frampton, and Stirling has said its musical style is more progressive than her first album. During its pre-sale, the album peaked at number one on the US iTunes electronic charts. On its released in USA the album reached the second position on Billboard 200, making Stirling's biggest sales week of her career. The album peaked on four different Billboard music charts.\n\nOfficial website: www.lindseystirling.com\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lindsey+Stirling\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Since forming in Atlanta 15 years ago, instrumental electronic rock band STS9 has experienced a meteoric rise to the forefront of the international music scene. Consistently ranked among Pollstar magazine’s list of top-grossing touring acts, STS9—Hunter Brown (guitar/sequences), Alana Rocklin (bass guitar), Jeffree Lerner (percussion), David Phipps (keyboards/synths) and Zach Velmer (drums)--continues to average over 5,000 tickets per city, boasting a genre defying list of opening acts along the way such as Snoop Dogg, Ghostland Observatory, Bassnectar, Thievery Corporation, Pretty Lights, NAS, Big Boi of Outkast and countless others.\n\nSTS9 truly does it all: from headlining stages at festivals such as the Ultra Music Festival, Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, Lollapalooza and Electric Daisy Carnival, to selling out shows around the country as an acoustic set-up in opera houses or as an electronic act in amphitheatres, to performing with Jay-Z in arenas, to running their own record label, 1320 RECORDS, to using their voice as a platform for change and raising significant amounts of money towards activism efforts (including $150,000 to The Make it Right Foundation, paving the way to rebuild a house in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans). Pushing boundaries is all in a day’s work for STS9.\n\n2013 was yet another big year for STS9. The band’s headlining Winter and Spring tour —their first months-long coast to coast outing in over two years—sold out the majority of their destinations with massive shows at Oakland’s Fox Theater, The Palladium in Los Angeles and Chicago’s Congress Theatre. The group then hit the festival circuit throughout the summer as they prep for the release of their next album, with headlining and/or main stage sets at Summer Camp, Wakarusa, Camp Bisco, and All Good. STS9 later hit the road for a co-headlining tour with Umphrey’s McGee, with huge stops at Chicago’s Northerly Island, Atlanta’s Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre, Philadelphia’s Mann Music Center, Boston’s Bank of America Pavilion, and the Filene Center at Wolf Trap outside of Washington, DC. The Summer concluded with the band’s annual sold out two-night run at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado, while the entire year ended with a 5-Night run at The Tabernacle in Atlanta.\n\nIn 2014, fans will continue to be treated to STS9’s largest touring production rig ever. Building off the groundbreaking “Great Cycle Spectacle” design, the band is leaving no stone unturned when it comes to delivering one of the most visually stunning shows on the road today.\n\nThe release of the bands latest studio EP, WHEN THE DUST SETTLES (the eleventh album in their full discography), keeps with XLR8R Magazine’s exclamation that STS9 is \"one of the country's most intriguing, innovative outfits around.” The EP was released in 2011 and debuted at #1 on the iTunes Electronic Charts and in Billboard’s Top 25.\n\nSTS9’s self-owned record label, 1320 RECORDS was founded on the principles of collaboration, cooperation, and community. The goal is clear: bring the music to the people in the most conscious, unique innovative and savvy ways possible. By doing so, the distance lessens between artists and fans, putting the power back in the hands of those that make music and those that live for it. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/STS9\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "\nScott Hansen (born February 7, 1977), professionally known as Tycho, is an American ambient music artist and producer, who is known as ISO50 for his photographic and design works. Tycho is currently signed to, and has released under, Ghostly International, but has also released music on Merck Records and Gammaphone Records. His song, Dictaphone's Lament, was used as the track on a music video entitled \"Live Life to the Fullest\", which was made by and featured on the action cartoon block Toonami. Additionally, his song Cascade (originally made for an Adult Swim/Ghostly International compilation) was played during the final moments of the original 11-year run of Toonami in 2008.\n\nHansen began releasing music over 10 years ago with The Science of Patterns EP. His first full-length, Sunrise Projector, came out in 2004, and as the critical acclaim continued in 2006 with the release of Past Is Prologue.\n\nIt was around 2008 that URBmagazine noted Tycho as one of the Next 100 artists to watch, and Hansen continued to release singles and experiment with more live instrumentation. In 2011, his meticulous process saw the release of Dive, his debut full-length for Ghostly International. Tranquil, nostalgic and melodic, the record established him beyond the realm of IDM and ambient.\n\nNow with Awake, Tycho's second Ghostly LP, the project returns as a true three-piece band comprised of Zac Brown (guitar, bass) and Rory O’Connor (live drums). Lengthy touring for Dive brought Tycho to its full potential, and in efforts to capture the energy on the road Hansen invited Brown and O’Connor in to the creative process. Both the sound and artwork of Awake capture Hansens stylistic shift, conjuring a more kintetic and percussive sensory experience. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tycho\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Wu-Tang Clan is a hip-hop group that consists of: RZA, GZA/Genius, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa. They are frequently joined by fellow childhood friend Cappadonna, a quasi member of the group. They were formed in (and are associated with) the New York City borough of Staten Island (referred to by members as \"Shaolin\"), though Masta Killa and GZA are from Brooklyn and Inspectah Deck is from the Bronx. They have gone on to become multi-platinum record producers, Grammy winners, TV and film stars, screenwriters, product spokespersons, business owners and, most recently, major motion picture composers. The Clan featured nine MCs until the death of Ol' Dirty Bastard in 2004. One of the most critically and commercially successful hip hop groups of all time, Wu-Tang Clan shot to fame through their uncompromising brand of hardcore rap music. Since their debut, they have introduced or launched the careers of numerous other artists and groups, and already in 1994 there were credited to be over 300 Wu-Tang Clan affiliates, known as the Wu-Tang Killa Bees, consisting of rappers, producers, and record label CEOs.\n\nThe founders of the Wu-Tang Clan were RZA, GZA, and Ol' Dirty Bastard, who had previously formed the group Force of the Imperial Master (later known as All In Together Now after the release of a popular single by that name). The group attracted the attention of some notable figures in the industry, including Biz Markie, but did not manage to secure a record deal. After the crew dissolved, GZA and RZA (then known as Prince Rakeem) embarked on their solo careers with Cold Chillin' Records and Tommy Boy Records respectively, but to little success. Their frustration with the workings of the hip hop music industry would provide the main inspiration to Wu-Tang Clan's revolutionary business plan. According to The Wu-Tang Manual, at the group's inception, RZA promised the members that if he had total control of the Wu-Tang empire, it would conquer the hip hop world within a dynastic cycle, after which he would relinquish his total control.\n\nWu-Tang Clan was gradually assembled in late 1992 from friends and accomplices from around Staten Island, New York, with RZA as the de-facto leader and the group's main producer. Two of the cousins, GZA (pronounced Jizza) and RZA (pronounced Rizza), created their new Wu-Tang aliases by mimicking the sound that the words \"genius\" and \"razor\" would make when scratched on a turntable.\n\n\"Wu-Tang\" comes from the name of the Taoist holy mountain Wu Dang in northwest Hubei Province in central China; it was also the site of the Ming Dynasty Purple Imperial City built during the reign of the Yongle Emperor in the early 15th century. RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard adopted the name for the group after seeing the kung fu film Shaolin and Wu Tang, which features a school of warriors trained in Wu-Tang style. The group's debut album loosely adopted a Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang theme, dividing the album into Shaolin and Wu-Tang sections and using dialogue excerpts as skits.\n\nThe group have also developed various backronyms for the name (as hip hop pioneers like KRS-One and Big Daddy Kane did with their names), including \"We Usually Take All the Niggas' Garments,\" \"Witty Unpredictable Talent and Natural Game\" and \"Wisdom, Universe, Truth, Allah, Nation, and God\".\n\nMethod Man has also mentioned that the \"Wu\" is the sound a sword makes when cutting through the air, and \"Tang\" is the sound it makes against a shield.\n\nThe Clan first became known to hip hop fans, and to major record labels, in 1993 (see 1993 in music) following the release of the independent single \"Protect Ya Neck\", which immediately gave the group a sizeable underground following. Though there was some difficulty in finding a record label that would sign Wu-Tang Clan while still allowing each member to record solo albums with other labels, Loud/RCA finally agreed, releasing their debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), in late 1993. This album was popular and critically-acclaimed, though it took some time to gain momentum. Though hip hop had long had a gritty texture, the surreal aggression and minimalist production of 36 Chambers nevertheless had a huge impact on the genre, and was to prove massively influential over the next decade. By the beginning of the 21st century, the album had become a regular fixture on \"Best Albums of the 90s\" lists as well as a frequent choice for \"Best Albums of All Time\" lists. The success of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) established the group as a creative and influential force in early 1990s hip hop, allowing GZA, RZA, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa to negotiate solo contracts.\n\nwww.wutang-corp.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Wu-Tang+Clan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Consistently ranked among Pollstar magazine’s list of top-grossing touring acts, STS9—Hunter Brown (guitar/sequences), Alana Rocklin (bass guitar), Jeffree Lerner (percussion), David Phipps (keyboards/synths) and Zach Velmer (drums)--continues to average over 5,000 tickets per city, boasting a genre defying list of opening acts along the way such as Snoop Dogg, Ghostland Observatory, Bassnectar, Thievery Corporation, Pretty Lights, NAS, Big Boi of Outkast and countless others.\n\nSTS9 truly does it all: from headlining stages at festivals such as the Ultra Music Festival, Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, Lollapalooza and Electric Daisy Carnival, to selling out shows around the country as an acoustic set-up in opera houses or as an electronic act in amphitheatres, to performing with Jay-Z in arenas, to running their own record label, 1320 RECORDS, to using their voice as a platform for change and raising significant amounts of money towards activism efforts (including $150,000 to The Make it Right Foundation, paving the way to rebuild a house in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans). Pushing boundaries is all in a day’s work for STS9.\n\n2013 was yet another big year for STS9. The band’s headlining Winter and Spring tour —their first months-long coast to coast outing in over two years—sold out the majority of their destinations with massive shows at Oakland’s Fox Theater, The Palladium in Los Angeles and Chicago’s Congress Theatre. The group then hit the festival circuit throughout the summer as they prep for the release of their next album, with headlining and/or main stage sets at Summer Camp, Wakarusa, Camp Bisco, and All Good. STS9 later hit the road for a co-headlining tour with Umphrey’s McGee, with huge stops at Chicago’s Northerly Island, Atlanta’s Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre, Philadelphia’s Mann Music Center, Boston’s Bank of America Pavilion, and the Filene Center at Wolf Trap outside of Washington, DC. The Summer concluded with the band’s annual sold out two-night run at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado, while the entire year ended with a 5-Night run at The Tabernacle in Atlanta.\n\nIn 2014, fans will continue to be treated to STS9’s largest touring production rig ever. Building off the groundbreaking “Great Cycle Spectacle” design, the band is leaving no stone unturned when it comes to delivering one of the most visually stunning shows on the road today.\n\nThe release of the bands latest studio EP, WHEN THE DUST SETTLES (the eleventh album in their full discography), keeps with XLR8R Magazine’s exclamation that STS9 is \"one of the country's most intriguing, innovative outfits around.” The EP was released in 2011 and debuted at #1 on the iTunes Electronic Charts and in Billboard’s Top 25.\n\nSTS9’s self-owned record label, 1320 RECORDS was founded on the principles of collaboration, cooperation, and community. The goal is clear: bring the music to the people in the most conscious, unique innovative and savvy ways possible. By doing so, the distance lessens between artists and fans, putting the power back in the hands of those that make music and those that live for it. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/STS9\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Brantley Gilbert (born January 20, 1985), is an American country rock music singer-songwriter. He has released two albums, both on the Average Joe's Entertainment Group label. His songs have also been recorded by Colt Ford and Jason Aldean. In February 2011, he left Average Joe's label to join Valory Music Group, where he has charted \"Country Must Be Country Wide\". A deluxe edition of Halfway to Heaven was released on September 13, 2011, two months before \"Country Must Be Country Wide\" reached number one on the Hot Country Songs charts.\n\nThe Country Must Be Country Wide Songfacts reports that Gilbert's debut album, Modern Day Prodigal Son was originally set to be released in 2006 but the label dropped him before it hit stores. After signing with Average Joe's entertainment in mid 2009, the album finally saw the light of day a few months later. Gilbert signed with Big Machine Records' Valory Music Group division in February 2011, and his new label will be re-releasing Modern Day Prodigal Son on August 23, 2011.\nThe album contains Country Must Be Country Wide, which is his third single and his first to reach both the Country chart and the Hot 100.\n\nBrantley Gilbert knows that tomorrow is no guarantee. Just over five years ago the talented singer/songwriter was ignoring his deepest ambition of becoming a country singer and was just going through the motions of everyday life. It wasn’t until a nearly-fatal car accident that Brantley opened his eyes, realized the importance of living each day to the fullest, and decided to pursue his love for music as a career.\n\nBrantley was born and raised in the small town of Jefferson, Georgia, just outside the Athens city limits. It is that upbringing and small town influence Brantley credits toward allowing him to cultivate his unique sound. With well-known rock bands REM and the B-52’s having roots nearby, Brantley’s taste in music always swayed toward a rock feel, but his true-to-life testimony of heartache, trials, triumph, and success found a home in country music.\n\nAfter taking the stage night-after-night with just his guitar and opening for other country artists throughout the southeast, Brantley began to notice familiar faces in the crowds. A group of believers who shared Brantley’s passion for life and music had developed, and pretty soon the following had taken-on a life of its own. Brantley quickly realized that his acoustic shows—however intimate—didn’t satisfy his audience’s thirst for his rock-infused country music. In order to meet their demand, Brantley formed a band.\n\n“We went from these acoustic shows to a bona fide country-rock-soul show that is wide-ass open,” says Gilbert. “Even when we play a ballad it’s high energy.”\n\nWith the fans demanding new music from Brantley, he came to Nashville, Tennessee where he soon signed with Warner Chappell Publishing and began to develop music for a debut album release. One of his songs, “The Best of Me,” was recorded by Jason Aldean and earned a spot on his Walmart exclusive release (WIDE OPEN) and ITunes. Since, Brantley has signed a record deal with Average Joe’s Entertainment and collaborated with top-charting act and labelmate Colt Ford to write and record, “Dirt Road Anthem,” which is currently featured on Ford’s multiple-week Top 25 Billboard album, RIDE THROUGH THE COUNTRY.\n\n“I’ve realized that life can be very short, and everyone should take advantage of it,” he said. “If you’re gonna live, do something with it. Make it great.”\n\nAnd great it is. Brantley celebrates the release of his sophomore album, HALFWAY TO HEAVEN, in March 2010 leading off with the single “Kick It In the Sticks.” HALFWAY TO HEAVEN follows his 2009 release, A MODERN DAY PRODIGAL SON, which features hit singles, “G.R.I.T.S.” and “Whenever We’re Alone.”\n\nAs tour dates multiply throughout the South, Brantley’s fan base continues to expand, and like most artists these days, fans can stay updated about tour dates and news via MySpace. His page garners more than 25,000 listeners daily— a number that has brought him to the #1 spot on MySpace Music Charts for both country and southern rock. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brantley+Gilbert\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Amos Lee (born 1978 as Ryan Anthony Massaro) is an American singer-songwriter whose musical style encompasses folk, rock and soul. His self-titled debut album is full of folk and soul, with a jazz twist.  The Flower Songfacts state that his fourth album, Mission Bell, which was released on January 25, 2011 debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 with 40,000 copies sold in its first week; these sales were the lowest for a #1 debut in the Nielsen SoundScan era.\n\nLee grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA. He has been quoted as saying that he is fortunate to have seen different sides of life in America. Lee enrolled at the University of South Carolina in 1995. He began to play guitar and write songs seriously while he studied English. After graduating with an English degree, Lee moved back to Philadelphia to teach elementary school. He later made the tough decision to stop teaching in order to pursue a career in music. Shortly thereafter, he released a self-produced EP that featured five of his original songs, which did extremely well in Philadelphia and created a buzz. Norah Jones was the person who finally gave Lee his big breakthrough when she asked him to open for her 2004 tour. Lee then went on to produce his self-titled debut album. In March and April of 2005 Lee opened for the tour that Merle Haggard and Bob Dylan were both embarking on, all 3 performers were extremely well received by critics as the tour went by, with Dylan receiving some of his strongest reviews in years. On October 3, 2006, Lee released his second album, \"Supply & Demand\" to critical and commercial acclaim.\n\nAt the age of only 27, Amos Lee has enjoyed notable success with his debut album and looks to have a promising future in the music business. His favorite artists and sources of inspiration include Stevie Wonder, Neil Young, John Prine, Bill Withers, and James Taylor. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Amos+Lee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Gary Clark Jr. (born February 15, 1984) is an American guitarist and actor based in Austin, Texas. Described as being the future of Texas blues, Clark's resume has included sharing the stage with various legends of rock and roll. He has stated that he is \"influenced by blues, jazz, soul [and] country, as well as hip hop\". Clark's musical trademarks are his extremely fuzzy guitar sound and smooth vocal style.\n\n\nGARY CLARK JR.began playing guitar in 1996 at the ripe young age of 12. Born and raised in Austin, TX, Gary continued to play small gigs throughout his early teens, until he popped on the radar of legendary promoter Clifford Antone, owner of the Austin blues club Antone's. Through Clifford's connections, Gary soon began sitting in and learning from an array of musical icons, including the incomparable Jimmie Vaughan. \n\nJimmie and others in the Austin music community mentored Gary along his path, facilitating his steady rise, and continued ascent in the Texas music scene. Gary's musical peers, as well as the Austin music community at-large, have showered him with critical acclaim for his galvanized live performances, and fervid expression. At one unexpected point of political recognition, mayor of Austin Kirk Watson proclaimed May 3, 2001 Gary Clark Jr Day. Gary was 18 years old at the time.\n\nGary went on to win the Austin Music Award for Best Blues and Electric Guitarist on three separate occasions, in addition to receiving awards from various Blues magazines and associations around the country. After playing the nationally televised show Austin City Limits and touring with the likes of artists such as Jimmie Vaughan, Pinetop Perkins, and Doyle Bramhall II, he continued his recording pursuits by releasing three self-produced albums, and creating the original score for the major motion picture Full Count. His creative versatility allowed him to transcend his own musical talents, while also starring as a principal character in John Sayle’s film Honeydripper, alongside actors Danny Glover and Stacy Keach.\n\nOriginally known as a blues musician and even compared to such greats as Stevie Ray Vaughan, Albert Collins and Albert King, Gary is stepping out...way out.  His upcoming CD will really test his blues fans.  Will they appreciate Gary's guitar chops and his soulful voice as he explores other genres?  Gary hopes so and he hopes they will continue with him on his journey.  And with this new sound, we're thinking Gary will pick up some new fans along the way.\n\nHIs first major label LP \"Blak and Blu\" was released on October 22, 2012 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Clark+Jr.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Oliver, a guitarist, discovered he had a knack for writing songs and formed the blues-based King Johnson, which continues to do frequent gigs on the Southern circuit. Chris, a bassist, began playing jazz and rock in New York, eventually teaming up with John Medeski and Billy Martin to form the successful jazz-funk trio Medeski, Martin & Wood. The brothers began jamming together at family functions, and the duo's roots-inflected blend of blues, folk, and rock quickly took shape. They privately released the Live at Tonic EP, which was drawn from their first-ever public concert at New York's Tonic venue on March 5, 2005. Signed to Blue Note Records, the Wood Brothers released their debut album, Ways Not to Lose, in 2006. The album, which features drummer Kenny Wollesen on five tracks, was produced by John Medeski and recorded at Allarie Studios in Shokan, NY. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Wood+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Recently having one of her sets described by Annie Mac as \"the best party set I've heard in a long time\" the wide-eyed, dodo racing, rabbit chasing girl of Lewis Carol's opium induced fantasies has officially been superseded.\n\nThis Alison didn't fall down anything; she jumped head first down the rabbit hole and landed straight on the decks. Armed with turntables, a killer vibe and an open mind, Alison turns countless dance floors across Australia into your favourite kind of Wonderland: more beats, less croquet.\n\nBeginning with a background in indie and classical, Wonderland's best card is her eclecticism. Throughout her youth she toured Europe as a principal cellist for the Sydney Youth Orchestra and later played bass in a successful local indie band.\n\nAfter inking a global deal with EMI, Wonderland released her debut compilation record - \"Welcome To Wonderland\" mid 2012, while her much anticipated first original's album is due out very soon! If the success of her remixes is anything to go by the record is set to be a game changer.\n\nWonderland has performed in LA at the official Grammy's Afterparty, all throughout Ibiza on top of MOS and the Brit Awards Afterparty in London. In Australia she has torn up main stages at Splendour in the Grass, Falls Festival, Southbound Festival, Stereosonic, Field Day, Parklife (nationally), Good Vibrations Festival, Harbourlife, Sydney Fashion Week, Future Music Festival, Coaster Festival, Secret Garden Festival and more, not to mention her sellout headline national tours.\n\nThe end of 2012 saw Wonderland taking the highly prestigious summer festival time slots. Playing main stage at Falls Festival in a headline slot after Hot Chip to a capacity crowd, Supporting PNAU Live at Wonderland Festival in Perth & again destroying the headline time slot after SBTRKT to a heaving tent at Southbound Festival this all within 1 WEEK!\n\nWonderland is the party, rumour has it she never sleeps and is reasonably good friends with Oprah. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alison+Wonderland\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Fitz and the Tantrums are an American soul group from Los Angeles, California. The group was founded in 2008 by Michael Fitzpatrick, who had begun writing soul music for a solo project on an old church organ he had purchased. He added friend James King to the group as an arranger and soon after expanded the band to a seven-piece, including several horns. Fitzpatrick shares the vocal duties with Noelle Scaggs. Other members include Joseph Karnes, Jeremy Ruzumna, and John Wicks.\n\nThe group's debut EP, Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, was released in 2009. Dangerbird Records signed the group in 2010 and issued their first full-length album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, in August of that year. The album reached #15 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Los Angeles Times music critic Ann Powers wrote, \"Fitz & the Tantrums is the kind of band that communicates best in concert, but this album serves as a fine proxy and party-starter.\" Aly Comingore of the Santa Barbara Independent wrote that the band members craft \"soulful, nostalgia pop that's not only infectious, but just fresh enough to make it stand apart from its predecessors.\"\n\nIn 2010 the group opened several dates on tour with Maroon 5. On January 12, 2011, Fitz & the Tantrums performed the songs \"MoneyGrabber\" and \"Don't Gotta Work It Out\" on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live in Los Angeles. In 2010 the groups music video for the song \"MoneyGrabber\" was incorporated into the opening scene of a sixth season episode of the CBS crime-drama Criminal Minds entitled \"Safe Haven\".\n\nFitzpatrick has said that the band's musical style can be fairly described as \"soul-influenced indie pop\". He noted that while the band is influenced by the classic songs of the Motown and Stax record labels, the band is not trying to create an exact replica of that music. In another interview, Fitzpatrick talked about his decision to not use guitars in the band. \"I did want to try and make a big sounding record without guitars,\" he said. \"For me, I just feel like in any music that has a band, the guitar is always there, it's always featured, it's always prevalent. I'm just sick of hearing it.\"\n\nIn 2012, the band signed to Elektra Records, and started to record their major-label debut More Than Just A Dream, which will be released on May 7, 2013. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fitz+and+the+Tantrums\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Elevation exists \"so that people far from God will be filled with life in Christ.\" That's the vision that was planted in the heart of Pastor Steven Furtick at the age of 16. In 2005, God assembled a group of families around Pastor Furtick to begin seeing this vision come to life.\n\nIn February of 2006, Elevation Church launched its first worship experience. Two and a half short years later Elevation Church is meeting in multiple locations with a weekly attendance that has topped 4,000. Through God's favor and a relentless pursuit of His vision we have watched over 2,000 people profess faith in Jesus Christ during our second year of ministry.\n\nCommitment to the vision of life transformation is what drives every corner of this ministry. These songs were birthed from the heart of this movement. Our hope is that through these songs, you'll experience a glimpse of this revolutionary move of God.\n\nThe band released three independent studio albums before they signed with Essential Records in 2011. For the Honor, their debut album on a major label, was released on November 21, 2011 which saw chart success on Billboard charts, including No. 1 on Heatseekers, No. 19 on the Christian Albums, and the Billboard 200 at No. 193. \"Nothing Is Wasted\" was released on February 19, 2013 on Essential, also seeing chart success – No. 1 on the Christian Albums chart and at No. 41 on the Billboard 200.[1][5]\n\nOnly King Forever, their third album on Essential, was released January 14, 2014, debuting at their highest charting position, No. 23 on the Billboard 200. This album was recorded live in Charlotte in 2013. Elevation Worship's fourth album, Wake Up the Wonder, was recorded live on August 1, 2014 at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, and was released on November 25, 2014. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elevation+Worship\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The Revivalists is an American rock band formed in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2007. The 7-piece band consists of Ed Williams (pedal steel guitar, guitar), David Shaw (lead vocals), Zack Feinberg (guitar), Rob Ingraham (saxophone), George Gekas (bass guitar), Andrew Campanelli (drums, percussion), and Michael Girardot (keyboards, trumpet). The group's sound has been described as \"a Crescent City-rhythm spin on jam-band jubilee.\"\n\nSince forming in 2007, the band's combination of danceable rock and soulful songwriting (and brilliantivity) has come to life through a meticulously-crafted and ever-evolving live performance. The band has been instrumental in the growth of New Orleans’ burgeoning indie rock scene, and they have achieved success and notoriety in the city’s competitive musical landscape.\n\nThe Revivalists have proven themselves as a live act.  They have managed to advance from low-profile local gigs to extensive touring, developing a loyal fan base at home and across the Gulf Coast Region and gaining footholds nationally. Abroad, they have commanded such venues as The Kennedy Center (Washington, DC), Sullivan Hall (New York City), Toad’s Place (New Haven, CT), and Smith’s Olde Bar (Atlanta, GA). At home, The Revivalists are regulars at The Howlin’ Wolf, The Republic, and the legendary Tipitina’s. They have shared stages with such notable acts as Perpetual Groove, Marco Benevento, Rebirth Brass Band, Ivan Neville’s Dumpstaphunk, The Lee Boys and Snarky Puppy. Additionally, they have established themselves as an engaging festival act, winning over audiences at French Quarter Fest, Crawfest and Foburg Festival in New Orleans, Hamstock Barbecue and Music Festival in Ridgeland, MS, and The Duke Ellington Jazz Festival in Washington, DC. Most recently, The Revivalists played the 2010 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. There, they caught the attention of Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke, who wrote about their performance on his blog on rollingstone.com.\n\nThe Revivalists have also grown as studio musicians. Their first release was listed as an editor’s pick in both the Jam and American Traditional Rock categories on CDBaby.com, despite being a humble five-song EP. Their second release, Vital Signs, is both the band’s first full-length album and a significant step forward in terms of production and scale. The young band was privileged to record under the guidance of Grammy Award-winning producer Chris Finney, whose resumé ranges from Dr. John to R.E.M. Vital Signs is the result of this collaboration. Soon after its release, Vital Signs became the top-selling album on CDBaby in the American Traditional Rock category, and was quickly selected to be featured in their newsletter. \n\nFeel free to contact the band at TheRevivalistsNOLA@gmail.com or through www.therevivalists.com.\n\nMembers:\nGeorge Gekas (bass)\nAndrew Campanelli (drums)\nZack Feinberg (guitar)\nDavid Shaw (vocals, guitar)\nEd “Steel” Williams (pedal steel guitar)\nRob Ingraham (saxophone, miscellaneous/other) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Revivalists\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Jackson Stell, known by his stage name of Big Wild, is an electronic DJ, producer, composer, and engineer. \n\nStell was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts. When he was only 14, Stell started making hip-hop influenced beats under the name \"JBeats\". However, it wasn't until his girlfriend took him to Big Sur California in 2012 that he began making music under the name Big Wild. Stell said in an interview with 303 Magazine, \"I never really had witnessed a landscape like that before being from Massachusetts. It made me want to do a music project where I could be adventurous, unique and big with my sound.\" Once under the name Big Wild, Stell began producing distinctively atmospheric, groove-oriented tracks.\n\nIn 2015, through Stell's Soundcloud, the Seattle-based electronic music duo ODESZA, had been exposed to his music and enjoyed it. ODESZA asked Stell to open for them at the San Francisco and LA stops of their tour, and Stell eventually joined them on their whole tour after he finished and released his remix of ODESZA's track \"Say My Name.\"\n\nIn 2016, Big Wild's track \"Aftergold\", featuring Tove Styrke, amassed millions of plays on many networks, such as Soundcloud and Youtube, and Stell started touring with other DJs and producers including GRiZ, Tycho, Pretty Lights, and Bassnectar.\n\nBig Wild's first EP, The Invincible EP, was released in early 2017 on ODESZA's Foreign Family Collective label, and included the single \"I Just Wanna\" plus features for Yuna and iDA HAWK. Big Wild released his debut album, Superdream, on February 1st, 2019 on all major platforms.\n\nStell set out on his own tour in spring 2017, hitting 27 dates around America.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Wild\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Two brothers, Seth Avett and Scott Avett, formed the group in 2000 after the breakup of the former rock band, Nemo, adding a third member, Bob Crawford. Subsequently, they have been joined by cellist Joe Kwon. The Avett Brothers combine old-time country, bluegrass, punk, pop melodies, folk, rock and roll, honky tonk and ragtime to produce a sound described by the Washington Post as \"post civil-war modern rock\", or by other reviewers as \"grungegrass\". For a long time the group eschewed labels, feeling that \"none would do the music justice.\" Ironically, the Avetts signed to Columbia Records on Independence Day 2008 to record their fifth album with acclaimed producer Rick Rubin. It's simply left up to each person to extract his or her own account from the Avetts' music.\"\n\nTheir live performances, generally at smaller venues, showcase their use of three-part harmony and southern rock feel, and are admired for being intense, energetic, and soulful. The Avetts have been picking up steam opening for Dave Matthews Band and playing SXSW and Newport Folk Festival.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "John Craigie is an American singer-songwriter. He has been hailed as a \"Modern-Day Troubadour\" in the style of Woody Guthrie and Ramblin' Jack Elliott.\n\nOver the years, Craigie has taken his unique musical style across the western United States.  He stays true to the essence of folk music, and the traditions of the seminal writers of our past century. With timeless melodies and insightful lyrics—interspersed with witty storytelling—his songs take many poetic turns before bringing you back home. His themes range from social commentary to personal empowerment,  political satire, and modern love. Craigie writes, sings, and plays for the people.\n\nThe story of Craigie’s first album begins with a new folk singer on the scene in Santa Cruz, CA, with seven years of songwriting pent-up in a 23 year old brain and a 6 year old guitar. In an attempt to put these songs down on disc, Craigie found himself in the middle of the woods, outside of Santa Cruz, in a one-room studio that also served as a recording studio. With the help of the very eccentric owner of the studio, in about three days, john had laid out over 20 songs. Satisfied with the sound john grabbed the rough mixes and began to pass it around to listeners and fellow musicians. Packaged in a home-made sleeve and case, “I always –ed you” became Craigie’s first album before he got a chance to change anything. It was too late. The response was huge and the demand for the raw sound kept it untouched. Still packaged in the same home-made style, it remains as one of john’s most beloved albums. Like most debut albums, it reflects the innocence and the honesty of a musician’s first step on his/her path.\n\nhttp://www.johncraigiemusic.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/John+Craigie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Big Head Todd & the Monsters is a rock band formed in 1986 in Colorado. The band has released eight studio albums since 1989 with their 1993 album Sister Sweetly going well beyond platinum in the US. The band has developed a sizeable live following especially in the Mountain States of the US. \n Big Head Todd and The Monsters – singer-guitarist Todd Park Mohr, bassist-singer Rob Squires, drummer-singer Brian Nevin and keyboardist-guitarist-singer Jeremy Lawton --  could have begun resting on their laurels back in 1993, when their Top 10 singles “Bittersweet,” “Broken Hearted Savior,” “Circle” and “It’s Alright” pushed the album Sister Sweetly to platinum certification. However, Mohr says, “I’ve fought throughout our career not to be a one-trick pony, to be the kind of band that has depth and diversity in its catalogue. I’m a fan of this band, and I’m constantly looking forward to what comes next.”\nThe essence of Big Head Todd and The Monsters – a rootsy, emotionally direct variety of rock ’n’ roll that lends itself particularly well to a live setting – has been winning fans since Mohr, Rob Squires and Brian Nevin started playing together in high school (Jeremy Lawton joined in 2004). Needless to say, the three never expected to be in the same band at this late date, but, as Mohr points out, “It was a really fortunate combination of musical personalities, and we’re still partners in every sense of the word.”\nThe band spent seven years developing their chemistry and amassing a following, boosted significantly by the independent releases Another Mayberry (1989) and Midnight Radio (1990), before being “discovered” by the listening public at large with 1993’s Sister Sweetly. After a major-label stint (Sister Sweetly, 1994’s Stratagem, 1997’s Beautiful World), during which the trio increasingly found itself frustrated artistically, they reclaimed their independent status (2001’s Riviera, 2004’s Crimes of Passion). “If it were not for our ability to do things for ourselves, we would have disappeared a long time ago,” Mohr allows.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Head+Todd+and+the+Monsters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Bob Weir (born Robert Hall Weir, October 16, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist, most recognized as a founding member of the Grateful Dead. After the Grateful Dead disbanded, Weir performed with The Other Ones, later known as The Dead, together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, and his current band, RatDog.\n\nWeir played mostly rhythm guitar during his career with the Grateful Dead. He is known for his unique style of complex voiceleading, bringing unusual depth and a new approach to the role of rhythm guitar expression.\n\nWeir was born in San Francisco, California and raised by his adoptive parents in the suburb of Atherton. He began playing guitar at age thirteen after less successful experimentation with the piano and the trumpet. He had trouble in school because of undiagnosed dyslexia and he was expelled from nearly every school he attended.  One of these was the Fountain Valley School in Colorado, where he befriended John Perry Barlow, who, along with Robert Hunter, would in time become the two main lyricists for the Grateful Dead.\n\nWeir played rhythm guitar and sang a portion of the lead vocals through all of the Dead's 30-year career. (In the fall of 1968, the Dead played some concerts without Weir and Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan. These shows, with the band billed as \"Mickey and the Hartbeats\", were intermixed with full-lineup Grateful Dead concerts. Late in the year, the band relented and took Weir and Pigpen back in full time.) In the late 1970s, he began to experiment with slide guitar techniques and perform certain songs during Dead shows using the slide. His unique guitar style is strongly influenced by the hard bop pianist McCoy Tyner and he has cited artists as diverse as John Coltrane, the Rev. Gary Davis, and Igor Stravinsky as influences\n\nShortly before Garcia's death in 1995, Weir formed another band, Ratdog Revue, later shortened to Ratdog. As of April 9, 2008, Weir has performed approximately 800 shows with Ratdog. Known for his raspy, deep tone, in Ratdog Weir sings covers by The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Chuck Berry, and Willie Dixon while also performing many Grateful Dead classics. In addition, Ratdog performs many of their own originals, most of which were released on the album Evening Moods.\n\nWeir has also participated in the various reformations of the Grateful Dead's members, including 1998, 2000 and 2002 stints as The Other Ones and in 2003 and 2004 as The Dead.\n\nDespite breaking his ribs in a tour bus accident in early October 2008, described in media outlets that \"It only hurts when I breathe, laugh, or hold a guitar,\" Weir is expected to perform with the remaining members of the Grateful Dead (Lesh, Kreutzmann, and Hart) with Jeff Chimenti (Ratdog) on Keyboards and Warren Haynes (Gov't Mule, Allman Brothers) on Lead Guitar and Vocals, on October 13, 2008, in a get out the vote Concert for Change at Penn State University. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Weir\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Wardruna is a Norwegian music group founded by Einar Kvitrafn Selvik. In 2009 Wardruna enchanted their listeners with their mesmerizing debut album ‘gap var Ginnunga’, which also was the first part of a planned trilogy. In the ensuing years the group have spent a lot of time on adapting their music to a live format and establishing a live band. This resulting in a handful of very special concerts, perhaps most notably when they performed in front of the majestic 1100-year-old Gokstad ship at the Viking Ship Museum in Norway.\n\nWith the use of the oldest of Nordic instruments and poetic metres as well as lyrics written in Norwegian, Old Norse and Proto-Norse tongue, Wardruna is now, after nearly three years in the making, finally ready to return with the second album in the ‘Runaljod’ trilogy entitled ‘Yggdrasil’. Multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Einar Kvitrafn Selvik has, together with vocalists Kristian Espedal (aka Gaahl) and Lindy-Fay Hella, managed to make ​​a strikingly beautiful and intense continuation of what was started with their first album, but without falling into the trap of merely repeating themselves. ‘Yggdrasil’ is also graced with guest appearances by renowned Icelandic composer Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson and Iceland’s leading rímur singer Steindór Andersen.\n\nThe ongoing ‘Runaljod’ trilogy is a musical rendition of the 24 runes in what is often referred to as the elder futhark. Some of the recordings are done outdoors in places or under circumstances of significance to each rune. Wardruna primarily use old and historical instruments such as primitive deer-hide frame drums, Kraviklyra, tagelharpe, mouth harp, goat horn, lur and more. Non-traditional instruments and other sources of sound like trees, rocks, water and torches are also used.\n\nAll of these elements are carefully woven into a rich musical landscape and complemented with whispering voices, melodic song and mighty choirs. Although Wardruna’s music share characteristics with music typically labeled as folk, world and/or ambient, none of these genres can really describe their unique style. It truly must be experienced. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Wardruna\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Bikini Kill was an American punk rock band formed in Olympia, Washington, in October 1990. The group consisted of vocalist and songwriter Kathleen Hanna, guitarist Billy Karren, bassist Kathi Wilcox, and drummer Tobi Vail. The band is widely considered to be the pioneer of the riot grrrl movement, and was notorious for its radical feminist lyrics and fiery performances. Their music was characteristically abrasive and hardcore-influenced.\n\nWhile occasionally collaborating with high-profile acts such as Nirvana and Joan Jett, Bikini Kill was well-known for shunning major labels and the mainstream rock press. After two full-length albums, several EPs and two compilations, the band disbanded in 1998.\n\nMain article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini_kill <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bikini+Kill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It consists of vocalist Josh Kiszka, guitarist Jake Kiszka, bassist Sam Kiszka, and drummer Danny Wagner. \n\nThey were signed to Lava Records in March 2017 and a month later the band released their debut studio EP, Black Smoke Rising. Their debut single, \"Highway Tune\", topped the Billboard US Mainstream Rock and Active Rock Rock stations in September 2017 for four weeks in a row. A second EP From the Fires, containing the four songs from Black Smoke Rising and four new songs, was released on November 10, 2017, alongside a second single, \"Safari Song\". \n\nThe band's heavy rock sound is influenced by the work of Led Zeppelin and many other rock and blues acts, with lead vocalist Josh Kiszka having a voice that has been compared to Robert Plant's \"husky howl.\n\nGreta Van Fleet's music has been categorized as hard rock and blues rock. Although all four members bonded over blues, each does have their own music tastes; Jake gravitates towards rock and roll, Sam likes jazz, Danny prefers folk, and Josh likes world music. Sam stated that \"It's not like we set out to be a rock and roll band, it's just that sound that comes out [when] we get together and play.\" Songwriting is done by the band as a whole after one of the four members finds the concept for a song. Danny said a lot of their songs are first written in a \"folk set up\" before evolving into something else.\n\nGreta Van Fleet are often compared to Led Zeppelin. Jake related that he \"... went through a year of really intensely studying what [Jimmy] Page did ...\", but he has studied other virtuoso rock guitarists in a similar manner, specifically mentioning Pete Townshend. Likewise, on his voice being compared to Robert Plant's, Josh said that Plant has certainly been an influence, \"though it's not what I was going for.\" Stating that he did not even know who Led Zeppelin was until high school, he explained that his singing style came out naturally one day while struggling to be heard over the rest of the band. In a March 2018 interview, Plant cited Greta Van Fleet as one of his favorite young bands, saying \"they are Led Zeppelin I\" and describing Josh as \"a beautiful little singer.\"\n\nSome of Jake's guitar influences include John Lee Hooker, Elmore James, Bert Jansch, Eric Clapton and Keith Richards. Some of the drummers that inspired Danny are Carmine Appice, John Bonham, Mitch Mitchell and Michael Shrieve.

    "headlinerBio": "There are at least 30 artists with this name:\n\n1. Sir Robert Bryson Hall II (born January 22, 1990), known by his stage name Logic, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Raised in Gaithersburg, Maryland, Logic developed an interest in music as a teenager, and ventured into a musical career in early 2009 releasing Logic: The Mixtape under the name \"Psychological\", and releasing a mixtape titled Young, Broke & Infamous in 2010. He signed with Visionary Music Group, before releasing three more mixtapes over three years.\n\nHis fourth mixtape, Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever (2013), was released to critical acclaim, and allowed Logic to secure a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings. He later released his debut studio album Under Pressure in October 2014, which debuted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200, eventually becoming certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and having sold more than 171,000 copies. Logic's second studio album The Incredible True Story was released in November 2015, receiving mostly positive reviews from critics. Also certified gold in the U.S., it sold over 185,000 copies. Logic released his fifth mixtape, Bobby Tarantino, in 2016.\n\nLogic's third studio album Everybody (2017) was his first to debut at number one in the U.S., with 247,000 album-equivalent units, of which 196,000 were pure album sales. The album spawned his first international top 10 single as a lead artist, \"1-800-273-8255\", which reached the top three on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOn February 23, 2018, Logic released a single titled \"44 More\". It was a sequel to \"44 Bars\", a song from Logic's 2016 mixtape Bobby Tarantino. The song peaked at number 22 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The following single, \"Overnight\", was released four days later on February 27. Logic would eventually release another single titled \"Everyday\", with record producer Marshmello on March 2. Logic would later announced his sixth mixtape titled Bobby Tarantino II, with a promotional video featuring the characters of the Adult Swim series Rick and Morty, on March 7. Bobby Tarantino II was released on March 9, 2018, through Def Jam and Visionary Music Group. The mixtape featured guest appearances from 2 Chainz, Big Sean, and Wiz Khalifa. On March 30, he was featured in the premier episode of Netflix's original documentary series, Rapture.\n\nOn September 28, 2018, Logic released his fourth studio album titled, YSIV. Before releasing the project, Logic released three singles: \"One Day\" featuring Ryan Tedder, \"The Return\" and \"Everybody Dies\". The album features the song “Wu Tang Forever” which features all the surviving members of the Wu Tang Clan.\n\nLogic has also announced an album titled Ultra 85, which currently has no release date. He has also announced that he has written a novel, which he plans to release sometime in 2019. He also has said that he has written and plans to star in his own movie, which he's began to work on.\n---------------\n\n3. Logic is the recording alias of Edward Harrison who is responsible for the soundtrack for the Neotokyo mod of the video game \"Half-Life 2\".\n\nNo public release of the OST has been published but it's possible to hear some tracks on the Neotokyo website. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Logic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "MercyMe is an American contemporary Christian band, originally formed in Greenville, Texas in the mid-1990s. The band signed with INO Records in 2001 and released their first album, Almost There, which propelled them into the mainstream spotlight with the smash hit \"I Can Only Imagine\". The album went on to sell more than 2 million records in only three years and earned the band an American Music Award nomination.  In 2002, the band released their popular second album, Spoken For, which produced two more Top 10 hits. The combined success of the band's first two albums garnered a nomination for the Favorite Contemporary Inspirational Artist at the American Music Awards.  In 2004, MercyMe released Undone which produced two Top 10 hits: Here With Me which also hit Billboard's Top 100 chart that same year, and In The Blink of an Eye which, as of the end of 2005, was at #5 on R&R's top Christian hits.  In 2005 they also released their Christmas album titled The Christmas Sessions.  2006 saw the release of the album Coming Up to Breathe, which peaked at number one on the Billboard Top Christian Albums, and #13 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Also released was Coming Up to Breathe Acoustic.  In 2007, MercyMe released their newest album, All That Is Within Me, which debuted at #15 on the Billboard Top 200 Chart.  In 2010  they released  The Generous Mr. Lovewell. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Christian Albums chart.

    "headlinerBio": "\nBon Iver is a Grammy Award winning  folk band from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, United States, and one of Justin Vernon's current and most notable music projects to date. The band also consists of Mike Noyce, Sean Carey and Matt MacCaughan. \n\nThe name 'Bon Iver' (pronounced \"bon ee-VAIR\") is a play on the French phrase 'bon hiver' meaning 'good winter'. Vernon independently released Bon Iver's debut album For Emma, Forever Ago in 2007, most of which was recorded during a four-month stay in a remote cabin in Wisconsin.\n\nWhile in high school and college Vernon founded the indie-rock bands Mount Vernon and DeYarmond Edison in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, where he still resides.\n\nAccording to the For Emma Songfacts, after the break-up of De Yarmond Edison, Vernon retreated to his father's log cabin, out in the woods of north-east Wisconsin to hibernate for three snowy months. There he collected his thoughts and formulated them into a suite of songs,  For Emma, Forever Ago . The album was originally self-released in late 2007 in a run of 500 copies and sold out instantly. \n\nThe album garnered critical acclaim, and was picked up by the indie-rock label Jagjaguwar, which gave the album a proper release on February 19th, 2008. The album was released in the UK and Europe by iconic indie 4AD on May 12, 2008.\n\nWhen released in the UK, For Emma, Forever Ago received 5/5 and \"Album of the Month\" reviews in both MOJO and Uncut magazines. It is currently the third highest rated album of 2008 on review-aggregator site Metacritic, with accolades from publications including The Village Voice, The Hartford Courant and The A.V. Club.\n\nThe group's second album Bon Iver, Bon Iver was released on June 17, 2011 to universal acclaim. It was named by Pitchfork Media as the best album of 2011 on their annual list. At the 2012 Grammys, the album won Best Alternative Album and the group was awarded Best New Artist, despite having debuted in 2007.\n\nwww.boniver.org <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bon+Iver\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "If you're familiar with bluegrass music, then you're tuned in to some of what Greensky Bluegrass does. They're also known to throw a great party, rock n roll, and (if the critics are to be believed) they have great songs. They are unquestionably a team of friends that traverse the country making music they enjoy. What makes Greensky different than Bluegrass? Poignant rural ballads about real people? Dobro tone that Jerry (Douglas or Garcia) would love? Distortion Pedals? Grit and attitude from a whiskey soaked card game? Indeed, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThis quintet from Michigan has been staying up late at all the coolest festivals and stopping to play your favorite clubs and theaters across America for 11 years now. Nearly 175 shows per year has prepared them for the rigorous task of continuity. Greensky Bluegrass isn't slowing down. \"They're coming to your town to help you party down.\" Yeah. Really. Like you never thought possible.\n\nAt the start of the millenium,some of these guys met, then they met more guys. They thought Greensky was a clever name for a bluegrass band. Fast forward to 2011 when they recorded their fourth studio record, called Handguns. Among them, words like, \"proud,\" \"killer,\" and \"damn right!\" have been spoken in regards to the music of Handguns.\n\nWhile they all may be accurate, we hope you'll find far more than you expected, hell - even more than we expected contained in this piece work that may well come to define one of 21st Century America's hardest working musical ensembles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Greensky+Bluegrass\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Greetings. My name is Trevor. I play music…and love doing it. It has been a wonderful teacher, friend, and companion over the years. This is the part where I tell you a little about my life… so far. I grew up in South Carolina until the age of 16. I had a wonderful childhood, a great family, and good friends. I started playing music fairly young. My dad was a drummer and a musician himself. I guess I got some of his genes. Every day after school, I would come home, pick up my guitar, and write songs for a couple hours. It was my favorite time of the whole day. I began playing for my parents, who supported me to the fullest. For my 15th or 16th birthday, my dad got me some time in his friend's recording studio. I made my first record, which was mostly sold to my friends and family. It was at that time when my family and I started taking the music more seriously. \n\nIn 10th grade, I was very fortunate to have traveled to California to attend Idyllwild School for the Arts, an international boarding school east of Los Angeles. My time there was some of the best years of my life. I studied classical guitar and met many wonderful people from around the world who greatly influenced my life in a profound way. My greatest lesson there was observing how art spoke to everyone…no matter what race, what faith, or what country you were from. I saw how it brought people together, and that made me feel good. \n\nIn my senior year of high school, I signed a record deal with Geffen Records. After graduation, I moved to LA to give my music full attention. I was very blessed to have worked with great producers such as John Alagia (John Mayer, Jason Mraz, Dave Matthews) and The Laboriel Brothers (Sting, Paul Mccartney). Unfortunately, other than an EP, none of the records I made with Geffen ever came out. They dropped me from the label in 2008. But that didn't deter me. I picked up my guitar, wrote 14 new songs, and recorded an acoustic album with my good friend/percussionist Chris Steele. We have named that album \"This is Blue.\" It was a wonderful, liberating experience. I feel very lucky to still have the opportunity to create music with good friends and people. \n\nOver the years, I have toured and played with wonderful acts such as Steel Pulse, The Wailers, Matisyahu, Stevie Nicks, Ben Harper, Colbie Caillat, Los Lobos, Ziggy Marley, Rusted Root, and many others. It has been such a blessing to cross paths with so many beautiful people and wonderful musicians. They all have influenced me so much. \n\nMy favorite part of the whole thing thus far is meeting new people on the road. It is funny how people come together, connect, and establish friendships. I never knew that I would have friends in Peoria, Illinois or Vail, Colorado. Through music, we have all been able to come together, share our ideas and love, and then move on. I cannot express how thankful I am to all the fans who have supported me over the years. I have truly greatly enjoyed meeting all of you. I hope we get to cross paths again soon. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read a little bit about my journey. I hope that your travels are going smoothly and unfolding nicely. Until we meet again… \n\nSo much love\nTrevor \n\nFor more information about Trevor go to trevorhallmusic.com.

    "headlinerBio": "OneRepublic is an American, self-proclaimed \"genreless\", band formed in Colorado Springs in 2002 by Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins. After a few years of moderate success, they have since drawn mainstream attention with the release of their single \"Apologize,\" which has sold in excess of 7 million singles worldwide.  The song, according to SoundScan Data, is one of only two songs that have reached 3 million legal downloads in history.  A remix of \"Apologize\" was featured on Timbaland's Shock Value and the band's debut album, Dreaming Out Loud, produced by Greg Wells. Their debut album was released in the United States on November 20, 2007, with international release dates staggered throughout early 2008. As of June 14, 2008, Dreaming Out Loud had sold 761,298 copies in the U.S. with the bands total album sales coming to over 1.5 million worldwide so far.  The band's second single, \"Stop and Stare,\" has also crossed the 2 million mark in terms of worldwide single sales. Their third single, \"Say (All I Need)\", has been released in the UK and in the U.S.\n\nOneRepublic's song \"Apologize\", written by Ryan Tedder, was released in its original version on the band's debut album Dreaming Out Loud. The song was also prominently featured as a remix on Timbaland's 2007 release of Shock Value. The single, as featured on Shock Value, has gone 3x Platinum (marking three million copies sold in the U.S) and 5 million copies worldwide. It peaked at number three on the U.K. Official Top 40 Week on November 11, 2007. The week of November 10, 2007, \"Apologize\" was the biggest radio airplay hit in the history of Top 40 radio in North America, racking up an astounding 10,331 spins in one week.  The song held the #1 position for five months before the record was broken by \"Bleeding Love\", a song co-written and produced by Tedder.\n\nThe band performed \"Apologize\" live on Fox's So You Think You Can Dance on August 2, 2007, and with Timbaland on an episode of One Life to Live in October 2007.

    "headlinerBio": "The Black Crowes was a blues-oriented hard rock jam band formed 1989 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States that has sold over 15 million albums and were hailed by Melody Maker as \"The Most Rock N' Roll Rock N' Roll Band In The World\" The band has toured with acts such as Aerosmith, ZZ Top, Jimmy Page, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Oasis and Lenny Kravitz. The Crowes are listed at #92 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".\n\nAt the time of their 1990 debut, the kind of rock & roll the Black Crowes specialize in was out of style. Only Guns N' Roses came close to approximating a vintage Stones-style raunch, but they were too angry and jagged to pull it off completely. The Black Crowes replicated that Stonesy swagger and Faces boogie perfectly. Vocalist Chris Robinson appropriated the sound and style of vintage Rod Stewart while guitarist Rich Robinson fused Keith Richards' lean attack with Ron Wood's messy rhythmic sense. At their best, the Black Crowes echo classic rock without slavishly imitating their influences.\n\nThe Robinson brothers originally formed the Black Crowes in Georgia in 1984. By the time of their 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker, the group comprised Chris Robinson (vocals), Rich Robinson (guitar), Johnny Colt (bass), Jeff Cease (guitar), and Steve Gorman (drums). \"Jealous Again,\" the first single from Shake Your Money Maker, was a moderate hit but it was the band's cover of Otis Redding's \"Hard to Handle\" that made the group a multi-platinum success. \"Hard to Handle\" climbed its way into the Top 40, propelling the album into the Top Ten. The acoustic ballad \"She Talks to Angels\" became the band's second Top 40 hit in the spring of 1991. Shake Your Money Maker would eventually sell over three million copies.\n\nThe Black Crowes delivered their second album, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, in the spring of 1992, adding new lead guitarist Marc Ford and keyboardist Eddie Harsch. It entered the charts at number one, but it didn't have as many hit singles as the debut; none of the singles cracked the Top 40 and only \"Remedy\" and \"Thorn in My Pride\" made the Top 100. Nevertheless, the band established themselves as a popular concert attraction that summer, selling out theaters across America. The Black Crowes' third album, Amorica, arrived in late 1994. Amorica debuted in the Top Ten, but none of the singles from the album made the charts; even though the record went gold, it slipped off the charts in early 1995.\n\nThree Snakes & One Charm, the group's fourth album, was released in July of 1996. The album entered the charts at number 15, but it quickly slipped out of the Top 50. Nevertheless, the album received the best reviews of any Crowes album since The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. Guitarist Marc Ford was fired from the Black Crowes in August, 1997; two years later, the group returned with By Your Side. In mid-2000, the band collaborated with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page on the double-disc Live at the Greek, an eclectic mix of newly recorded Zeppelin covers and additional classic blues cuts. A Tribute to a Work in Progress: Greatest Hits 1990-1999, a 16-track best-of compilation was also released in mid-2000. The Don Was-produced Lions appeared in spring 2001, and a summer tour with Oasis -- the Tour of Brotherly Love -- followed in June. But all was apparently not well with the group, in January of 2002 the band announced that they were on hiatus. Drummer Steve Gorman was fired from the band, and Chris Robinson announced his intentions for a solo career.\n\nThe Black Crowes have since reunited.  All members circa 1992 are back, with the addition of one of their previous bassists, Sven Pipien, and harmony singers Mona Lisa Young and Charity White.  They are enjoying a renaissance within the group as well as with their longtime fan base and have been consistently touring since formally reuniting in March 2005.  In November of 2007, it was announced that North Mississippi Allstar guitarist Luther Dickinson formally joined the band, replacing Paul Stacey. He appears throughout the Crowes' album Warpaint, which was released in March of 2008.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Black+Crowes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

At its creation, the group was called \"Urban Atmosphere\". Unlike many hip hop groups, Atmosphere provides its own live instrumentation, usually consisting of bass guitar and drums. Atmosphere originally consisted of Spawn (MC), ANT (producer) and Slug (DJ, at the time). After Spawn left the group (now rapping under the name Rek The Heavyweight) the line up was set, with Slug, ANT and a rotating DJ. Currently the group consists of rapper Slug (Sean Daley), producer Ant (Anthony Davis) and Touring DJ Mr. Dibbs (Brad Forste). Slug is also one of the co-founders of a Minneapolis hip hop label called Rhymesayers Entertainment. The band has had hit singles on a variety of Billboard charts in the United States: 2002's \"Modern Man's Hustle\" went to #18 on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart and 2008's \"You\" hit #38 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. Atmosphere's albums include Overcast! (1997), God Loves Ugly (2002), Seven's Travels (2003), You Can't Imagine How Much Fun We're Having (2005), When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold (2008), The Family Sign (2011) and Southsiders (2014).\n\n2) A Polish rock group, established in 1993 in Leszno, Poland, with Marcin Rozynek as a vocalist.

Atmosphere was awarded the Album debut of the year 1997 by magazine Tylko Rock and was nominated for the award Fryderyk in 1998 in the category Debut of the Year. In 1998, Atmosphere appeared at the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole with song Niewielki Skrawek Ziemi. Disbanded after Marcin Rozynek departure for a solo career.

    "headlinerBio": "Pnuma arrives at a time when the music scene is in need of something new, bringing with them a refreshing new sound. Pnuma’s story began as a musical meeting in Virginia. There, through introduction by a mutual friend, the three founding members met, played together, and a week later became a band. The trio quickly discovered their sound and made the move to Memphis, Tennessee. Since the beginning, things have progressed naturally, and quickly. Pnuma's innovative brand of atmospheric soul trance is a captivating sound that meshes dance music elements with traditional jazz and funk sensibilities. Riding on the cusp of futuristic innovation while remaining in tune with their past influences, Pnuma allows their musicianship to speak for itself, offering beat-driven, precise compositions that still allow ample space for free thought and movement. It's instrumental, improvisational dance music for a new era in the live electronic realm, appealing to jam fans, hip-hop heads, and electronic dance party fanatics alike. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/PNUMA\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Aaron Dontez Yates (born November 8, 1971 in Kansas City, Missouri), better known by his stage name Tech N9ne or Tecca Nina is an American rapper, co-owner of Strange Music Records and actor. His career has spanned over 24 years, during which he has released eleven albums. According to the He's a Mental Giant Songfacts, his stage name originated from the TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun, given to him by rapper Black Walt due to his fast rhyming style. (Tech is short for technique and 9 is the number of completion. That's why he says the technique's complete so often.)\n\nHis tenth studio album, K.O.D., was released October 27, 2009. He has spent his illustrious career making sure he’s been grinding harder than the average rapper, and is the best selling artist out of his hometown. With nine solo albums and two powerhouse collaboration projects under his belt, the Kansas City MC’s flow is sharper and slicker than it’s ever been.\n“This is another roller coaster ride,” explains TECH N9NE about the release.  “When it came time for Sickology 101, I knew I wanted to do a collabo album based on the study of being sick. It’s a beginner’s course for people who don’t know how to be sick lyrically or how to choose sick beats. It all starts with beats because they tell me exactly what to do.” Epic beats from YoungFyre, Wyshmaster, Seven and Matic Lee set the stage for TECH N9NE to weave his introspective and sometimes roguish lyrics around. \n\nSickology 101 brims with stellar appearances from lyrical heavyweights. On the opening title track, TECH N9NE slays alongside Chino XL and Crooked I, pulling listeners into the Hip-Hop classroom for a lesson in murdering a beat. It’s a twisted vision forged on undeniable grooves and quixotic wordplay. \n\nThe single, “Nothin,’” is an inspiring, honest anthem that features Messy Marv and Big Scoob. Meanwhile, on “Midwest Choppers 2,” TECH N9NE and Krayzie Bone cruise to the depths of darkness. “Krayzie Bone came through and murdered it,” says TECH N9NE. “I modeled the song after movies. When you do a sequel, there has to be a bigger body count and more people have to die. ‘Midwest Choppers 2’ is Autobahn-style. It makes you want to speed.” \n\nTECH N9NE’s inimitable flow and rhyming take center stage on solo tracks, including the haunting, hypnotic “Red Nose.” He doesn’t pull any punches on the vitriolic, YoungFyre-produced “Blown Away,” either. It’s an open letter to several prominent urban artists who refused to play before him at radio festivals despite his massive concert draw. \n\nWith hits like “I’m A Playa,” “Caribou Lou” (which boasts 7.2 million MySpace plays), “Riotmaker,” “Like Yeah” and “Everybody Move,” it’s no wonder TECH N9NE counts a total of over 4.5 million YouTube video plays and an average of 40,000 MySpace visitors each day. His success knows no limits. The July 2008 release, Killer, debuted at Number 1 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart and Number 12 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. He did it all on his own. There was no major label — just TECH N9NE’s own record company, Strange Music. TECH N9NE’s tracks have appeared in films like Gang Related and Alpha Dog as well as various TV shows, and he recently made his motion picture debut in The Life of Lucky Cucumber alongside members of MTV’s “Jackass” crew. \n\nIt hasn’t been an easy road, but TECH N9NE soldiers on and he’ll never stop. “They call me devil worshipper because I’m different. I give you music for my core. They’re the people that put me over the million mark. I raise my middle finger to everybody who judges me because my core audience is there for me. They will always love me, but I’m trying to reach others, too. It’s not over. My music is supposed to be for everybody, but some people just don’t get it. This album is the result; swallow it. It’s middle finger music, all-day and all-night.” \n\nTECH N9NE never stops bringing that music directly to his fans, constantly reinforcing his status as one of the hardest-touring rap acts in the business.  In 2008, TECH N9NE performed over 200 shows and he doesn’t show any signs of slowing down in 2009.  In April, TECH will head out in support of Sickology 101 and spend two months on the road, performing live for his rabid fans.   \n\nSickology 101 is prepping the world for TECH N9NE’s next masterpiece, K.O.D. “I want people to know that I’m getting better and better and I’m a machine. I do these collabo albums to give the fans more. This is a bridge record to K.O.D. It’s the farewell to the TECH N9NE you’ve known lately. It’s getting darker. A lot of people might not be able to go to the place I’m going, but this place is my specialty.” \n\n“I don’t need people to kiss my hand,” assures TECH N9NE. “I’m not trippin’ on status, and I’m not a narcissist when it comes to rap. It’s my heart and soul pouring onto the paper. I write my life and I can’t hold back. This is what I know.”\n\nOrigin: Kansas City, Missouri\nYear Formed: 1991\nOfficial Site: http://www.therealtechn9ne.com/\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tech+N9ne\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Pat Green was born in San Antonio and raised in Waco, Texas, the eighth of nine siblings. His father was a stage actor, and Green fell in love with the musicals his father acted in.  Green began his musical career when he was 18 and in college at Texas Tech in Lubbock. \"I started playing guitar to pick up the chicks,\" Green laughs. \"Before that, I only sang in the shower. I could mimic other people's voices. It took me a long time to find my own voice, but once I did, I became very comfortable with it. It's not real pretty but it's believable.\"  During those college years, Green started playing clubs and opening shows for other artists. In 1995, he put out his first independent record.  \"I don't know exactly where it began, if it was Willie Nelson's picnic or one of Jerry Jeff's shows, but I got asked to play and there was a huge crowd there,\" Green says. \"After that show, we started getting some radio support. All of a sudden, everything started happening at once. We were selling a ton of records. We were able sell out Billy Bob's. In Dallas-Fort Worth, we were selling 4, 5, 6000 seats. In Houston and everywhere else, it started being 1000, 2000 seats. It just started steamrolling. I think it was a combination of the popularity of Robert Earl Keen, Jerry Jeff Walker and Willie Nelson leading the forefront for us little guys. We just all fell in line behind them.\"  The result of that faith was Green's 2001 major-label debut, Three Days, on Republic/Universal. The album Wave On Wave followed in 2003, and debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard country albums chart, and the title track cracked the Top 5 on the singles chart. He released Lucky Ones in 2004. In 2006, after a move to the RCA imprint BNA, he issued Cannonball.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Green\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The String Cheese Incident (SCI) is a US jam band formed in Crested Butte, Colorado in 1993. The band's music has elements of bluegrass as well as rock, electronica, calypso, country, funk, jazz, Latin, progressive rock, reggae, and occasional psychedelia. All members write original compositions and sing.  From playing local gigs at ski resorts in exchange for free lift tickets, the band is composed of Michael Kang (acoustic/electric mandolin, electric guitar, and violin), Michael Travis (drums and percussion), Bill Nershi (acoustic guitar, lap steel guitar, and electric slide guitar), Kyle Hollingsworth (piano, organ, Rhodes, and accordion), and Keith Moseley (bass guitar), and, in 2006, Jason Hann (auxiliary percussion).  The String Cheese Incident has been described as a democratic ensemble rather than a band, since all of the members contribute their own original compositions to the group’s burgeoning library and share the vocal burden on a number of cover versions as well as their own songs. If a de facto leader had to be named, such a title would probably fall upon Nershi, who is responsible for the bulk of the group’s original song library.  From their management, Madison House Inc.:  \"The String Cheese Incident has emerged as one of America’s most significant independent bands. Born in 1993 in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, SCI has since released 6 albums, 3 DVDs and countless live recordings from their relentless tour schedule. Their 14 year history is packed full of surreal experiences, epic moments, groundbreaking involvement and huge accomplishments. They have been recognized for their commitment to musical creativity and integrity, for their community spirit, philanthropic endeavors, and for their innovative approach to the business of music.    When The String Cheese Incident’s growth first started gaining momentum over a decade ago, when the internet was just beginning to take hold and the major-label business model was failing, the band decided to make music on their own terms.    Since then, The String Cheese Incident has gone on to carve out a completely different approach to the business of music; they are truly pioneers of a new way of “making a band.”  With the World Wide Web as their tool, SCI was among the first artists to disseminate information via the internet, such as tour dates, release information, and other news, to their growing fan base.  Rather than doing business on such terms as “the bottom line,” The String Cheese Incident put their music and their fans first, opening companies of their own, including a ticketing company, a merchandise company and a fan travel agency, to best serve their community. The band’s record label, SCI Fidelity Records, has always operated under the same ideals. Even early on, SCI Fidelity embraced downloadable music and file sharing, delivering SCI’s “On the Road” series, where every show the band plays is made available for download on the internet.  Whether they realized it at the time or not, The String Cheese Incident was inventing grassroots band development.  Today, literally hundreds of bands are using some version of this same approach to building a band.     The String Cheese Incident’s commitment goes well beyond their immediate community, and even beyond the music community as a whole. Early on, the band took a serious interest in giving back to the communities that they visited, and they were among the first performers to encourage “Green” shows and tours.  SCI’s support has helped give rise to such not-for-profit organizations as Conscious Alliance, Rock the Earth, and Head Count. In 2002, when the band’s right to sell tickets to their own shows became threatened by ticketing giant Ticketmaster, the band stood strong for the independent music community and filed a lawsuit against the company.  All the while, The String Cheese Incident has stayed committed to music as a creative endeavor, not just in their recordings but also in their live performances.  The list of SCI’s special guests and collaborators is long and diverse. Their annual events such as Horning’s Hideout, and holiday shows such as New Year’s and Halloween, have helped redefine the concert experience and has garnered the band a reputation as live music vibe innovators.\"  Some side groups are eoto, zilla with Jamie Janover, Zuvuya, Honkytonk Homeslice, Billy nershi's Plue Planet, Pangaea, The Trancident & Keller Williams with Moseley Droll and Sipe  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+String+Cheese+Incident\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Diana Ross (born Diane Ernestine Earle Ross on 26 March 1944 in Detroit, Michigan, USA) is an American soul, R&B and pop singer and actress. Ross is one of the most successful female artists of her era, both due to her solo work and her role as lead singer of The Supremes during the 1960s.  In 1959, Ross was brought to the attention of Milton Jenkins, the manager of the local doo-wop group The Primes, by Mary Wilson. Primes member Paul Williams convinced Jenkins to enlist Ross in the sister group The Primettes, which included Wilson, Florence Ballard and Betty McGlown.  In 1976, Billboard magazine named her the female entertainer of the century. In 1993, The Guinness Book Of World Records pronounced her the most successful female artist ever (the title is now attributed to Madonna), partly due to her combined total of eighteen number-one singles, six of them recorded solo and the remaining dozen from her work with the Supremes.  She was also one of the few pop singers to find modest success in the acting world winning an Academy Award nomination for her role as Billie Holiday in the 1972 film, \"Lady Sings the Blues\" as well as having hits with other film roles such as \"Mahogany\", \"Out of Darkness\" and \"Double Platinum\", not to mention her role in \"The Wiz\".  Ms. Ross has been awarded many lifetime achievement accolades from many organizations and media outlets, including BET, Soul Train, the NAACP Image Awards, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2007 and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement in 2011.  Her professional vocal collaborators have included the following during her career: Marvin Gaye, Lionel Richie, Rod Stewart, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Julio Iglesias, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo, Westlife, and Smokey Robinson, among others.   <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Diana+Ross\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The Head and the Heart is a folk band which formed in 2009 in Seattle, Washington, United States. The band consists of Josiah Johnson (vocals, guitar), Jonathan Russell (vocals, guitar), Charity Rose Thielen (violin, vocals), Chris Zasche (bass), Kenny Hensley (keyboards) and Tyler Williams (drums).  Composed primarily of transplants to the Seattle area, The Head and the Heart write and play songs that speak to the newness of a fresh start, of the ghosts left behind, of moving forward, all brimming with a soulfulness and hope for a better life than the one we've all been sold.  Stylistically, think a folksy Beatles or The Avett Brothers with a little extra oomph. Catchy piano melodies stand side by side with a tight trio of harmonies, and solid minimalist drums, groovin' bass, and plenty of hand percussion and foot stomps make the live show inspiring and really goddamn fun.  After the band self-released its eponymous debut album in June 2010, the emblematic Seattle label Sub Pop re-released the album. For the Sub Pop version, the song “Sounds like Hallelujah” has been re-recorded, live favorite “Rivers and Roads” has been added, and the album has been re-mastered. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Head+and+the+Heart\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Gov't Mule is a southern rock/jam band formed in 1994 as a side project to The Allman Brothers Band, but has taken on a life of its own. Like many jam bands, Gov't Mule does not get much radio airplay but is popular due to constant touring and intense fan loyalty. \n\nWhen the Allman Brothers Band reformed in 1989 in response to the popularity of the Dreams box set, Warren Haynes was added on lead guitar and Allen Woody on bass. The two shared a love for '60s power trios, like Cream, Jimi Hendrix Experience, and James Gang. With no bands making similar music in the 90s (except ZZ Top), Haynes, Woody, and former Dickey Betts drummer Matt Abts came together as Gov't Mule during Allman Brothers' breaks. (It is likely that Haynes and Abts first met during the recording of the Dickey Betts Band CD \"Pattern Disruptive\" in 1988.)  They released their debut album the selftitled Gov't Mule in 1995. It was followed by Live from Roseland Ballroom.\n\nWhen it became apparent that the Allman Brothers weren't planning on recording any new material, Haynes and Woody left to concentrate full-time on Gov't Mule in 1997. Dose, the studio follow up to their first studio effort, was released in early 1998. They were joined by members of the Allman Brothers, the Black Crowes, and Parliament/Funkadelic for their 1998 New Year's Eve concert. This was released in both a two and four CD version as Live ... With A Little Help From Our Friends. The band exposed some of their roots with covers of Neil Young, Free, Traffic, Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath, Mongo Santamaria (via John Coltrane) and Frank Zappa.\n\nIn 2000, the band released Life Before Insanity to critical praise. Many thought that this would be Gov't Mule's breakthrough CD. However, Woody was found dead in New York City in August. Haynes and Abts considered breaking up the band but did stage a concert called \"One for Woody\" to raise money for his daughter's education. The Allman Brothers, the Black Crowes, members of the Grateful Dead, and other friends of Woody also performed at the concert.\n\nAt both the \"One for Woody\" performance and other shows, Haynes began appearing with the Allman Brothers Band again. With Dickey Betts' departure from the Allmans, Warren came back full time to the band at the beginning of 2001 and has continued splitting his time between the Allmans and for a period Phil Lesh and Friends and the reformed Dead as well as Gov't Mule (performing acoustic gigs with just Haynes on guitar and Abts on percussion and as The New School of Gov't Mule with Widespread Panic's Dave Schools on bass and Chuck Leavell, formerly of the Allman Brothers and known for his current work with the Rolling Stones on keyboards).\n\nThe next year, Haynes and Abts began to record a tribute CD using Woody's favorite bass players. These sessions resulted in two CDs The Deep End, Volume 1 (2001) and The Deep End, Volume 2 (2002). A documentary of the recording sessions was also made by Phish bassist Mike Gordon called Rising Low. Bass contributions to the CDs came from Jack Bruce of Cream, John Entwisle of The Who, Mike Watt of Minutemen, Les Claypool of Primus, Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Chris Squire of Yes among others.\n\nWhen it came to touring in support of the Deep End CDs, Haynes and Abts used a revolving door of keyboardists and bassists. Keyboardists included Chuck Leavell, Rob Barraco of Phil Lesh and Friends and Zen Tricksters, Phish's Page McConnell and Danny Louis. Bassists included among others, Dave Schools, Oteil Burbridge of the Allman Brothers, Les Claypool, Victor Wooten of the Flecktones, George Porter Jr. of The Meters, Greg Rzab formerly of The Black Crowes and the Buddy Guy Band and Andy Hess, also formerly of The Black Crowes. Louis and Hess were eventually added as permanent members of Gov't Mule. They continue to tour extensively and have become staple acts at many music festivals including Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Vegoose, and their annual New Orleans Jazzfest night show (where they filmed and recorded the last show of the Deepest End tours, with 17 guest musicians in a 6 hour show) wich was released on CD/DVD as The Deepest End, Live in Concert.\n\nThe first CD with Louis and Hess Deja Voodoo was released in September 2004. Additional material from those sessions was released in 2005 as and EP entitled Mo' Voodoo. \nThe new lineup's second release, titled High and Mighty, was released on August 22, 2006.\nA third, Mighty High, was released in 2007 it features reggae and dub versions of classic Mule covers and originals with special guest appearances by Willi Williams, Michael Franti and Toots Hibbert, <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gov%27t+Mule\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "NOFX is a punk rock band from Los Angeles, California, United States, formed in 1983. The original lineup included singer/bassist Fat Mike, drummer Erik Sandin, and guitarist Eric Melvin. Since 1991, the lineup has remained the same, with El Hefe playing guitar and trumpet. They have released 11 full-length studio albums, 15 EPs, 2 live albums, and many 7\" singles. The group has sold over 6 million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent acts of all time.\n\nThe band's sound is diverse, utilizing elements of skate punk, hardcore punk, reggae, and other music genres. Their lyrics generally satirize issues such as politics, society, various subcultures, racism, the music industry, and religion, often using a large amount of comedy.\n\nNOFX's first recording was a demo from 1983, produced by The Germs drummer Don Bolles, which did not sell any copies. They released their self-titled debut EP on Mystic Records in 1985, which was later re-released in 1992 as part of the Maximum RocknRoll CD. For a year, Erik Sandin left the band and was replaced by Scott Sellers, then Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident. In 1986, the band released So What if We're on Mystic!. Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the EP The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This!, attacking the PMRC's call for censorship of music. The original cover was an edited S&M photo, but the re-released version was changed to a photo of Eric Melvin.\n\nEric Sandin returned and they recorded Liberal Animation in 1988 (before Dave was replaced by Steve) with Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. Although the title and some lyrics mocked vegetarianism and animal rights, Fat Mike says that he became a vegetarian after he wrote Liberal Animation. 'If a big enough animal had a chance it would eat you up!' The album was re-released in 1991 on Gurewitz's label Epitaph. Dave then left the band and was replaced by Steve Kidwiller. NOFX had signed to Epitaph by 1989, releasing their second album, titled S&M Airlines. 1990 saw the release of Ribbed. By 1991, Aaron Abeyta (aka El Hefe), joined to round out the group. White Trash, Two Heebs and a Beanwas released in 1992, which originally had the title White Trash, Two Kikes, and a Spic. The original title was changed because Eric Melvin's grandmother was upset about the racial epithets.\n\nIt was not until the 1994 release of Punk in Drublic that the band had a commercial breakthrough, with the album going gold. In the same year, pop punk entered the mainstream with the success of The Offspring's Smash and Green Day's Dookie. \n\nIn 1996 they released Heavy Petting Zoo, which wasn't very popular among its fans because it showed a different sound in some tracks. Their 1997 record So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes was faster, with more ska and reggae, and was well received by the public, although its title shocked everybody because it seemed as it was going to be their last album. They soon stated it wasn't true.\n\nIn 1999, the band released The Decline, a fiery and pessimistic social commentary. Having a duration of 18 minutes and 23 seconds, it is nearly the longest punk song to date, second only to \"Yes Sir, I Will\" by Crass, which spans more than 22 minutes.\n\nThe coming of a new century marked the end of NOFX in Epitaph Records. In 2000 they released Pump Up the Valuum, which in many people's opinion is a good record but still is missing something.\n\nIn 2003, NOFX released War on Errorism, and launched their anti-George W. Bush campaign. Fat Mike organized the website Punkvoter.com, compiled two chart-topping Rock Against Bush compilations, and kicked off a Rock Against Bush United States tour. The band has released many EPs (i.e. Fuck the Kids, The Longest Line) on Fat Mike's own label Fat Wreck Chords. In February 2005, they launched the NOFX 7\" of the Month Club, a subscription-based service which saw the release of one new EP almost monthly, from February 2005 to March 2006 (a total of 12 releases). The cover art for these EPs were chosen from fan-submitted entries. The first 3000 subscribers to the club received all of their records on colored vinyl. Fat Wreck Chords later released full sets of the EPs.\n\nOn March 14, 2006, an EP entitled Never Trust a Hippy was released. The EP was followed on April 18 by the album Wolves in Wolves' Clothing. On September 12, 2006, the video game EA Sports NHL07 was released, featuring the title track of the latter album on its soundtrack.\n\nThe band recorded three nights of shows in San Francisco, California for the live album, They've Actually Gotten Worse Live! that was released on November 20, 2007.\n\nNOFX aired in 2008 a reality show on Fuse TV called NOFX: Backstage Passport, chronicling their recent worldwide tour full of mishaps and fun stuff.\n\nNOFX released their eleventh full length, Coaster, on April 28, 2009.\n\nNOFX will release their twelfth full length, Self/Entitled, on September 11th, 2012.\n\nOfficial site: http://nofxofficialwebsite.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/NOFX\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The Black Crowes was a blues-oriented hard rock jam band formed 1989 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States that has sold over 15 million albums and were hailed by Melody Maker as \"The Most Rock N' Roll Rock N' Roll Band In The World\" The band has toured with acts such as Aerosmith, ZZ Top, Jimmy Page, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Oasis and Lenny Kravitz. The Crowes are listed at #92 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".\n\nAt the time of their 1990 debut, the kind of rock & roll the Black Crowes specialize in was out of style. Only Guns N' Roses came close to approximating a vintage Stones-style raunch, but they were too angry and jagged to pull it off completely. The Black Crowes replicated that Stonesy swagger and Faces boogie perfectly. Vocalist Chris Robinson appropriated the sound and style of vintage Rod Stewart while guitarist Rich Robinson fused Keith Richards' lean attack with Ron Wood's messy rhythmic sense. At their best, the Black Crowes echo classic rock without slavishly imitating their influences.\n\nThe Robinson brothers originally formed the Black Crowes in Georgia in 1984. By the time of their 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker, the group comprised Chris Robinson (vocals), Rich Robinson (guitar), Johnny Colt (bass), Jeff Cease (guitar), and Steve Gorman (drums). \"Jealous Again,\" the first single from Shake Your Money Maker, was a moderate hit but it was the band's cover of Otis Redding's \"Hard to Handle\" that made the group a multi-platinum success. \"Hard to Handle\" climbed its way into the Top 40, propelling the album into the Top Ten. The acoustic ballad \"She Talks to Angels\" became the band's second Top 40 hit in the spring of 1991. Shake Your Money Maker would eventually sell over three million copies.\n\nThe Black Crowes delivered their second album, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, in the spring of 1992, adding new lead guitarist Marc Ford and keyboardist Eddie Harsch. It entered the charts at number one, but it didn't have as many hit singles as the debut; none of the singles cracked the Top 40 and only \"Remedy\" and \"Thorn in My Pride\" made the Top 100. Nevertheless, the band established themselves as a popular concert attraction that summer, selling out theaters across America. The Black Crowes' third album, Amorica, arrived in late 1994. Amorica debuted in the Top Ten, but none of the singles from the album made the charts; even though the record went gold, it slipped off the charts in early 1995.\n\nThree Snakes & One Charm, the group's fourth album, was released in July of 1996. The album entered the charts at number 15, but it quickly slipped out of the Top 50. Nevertheless, the album received the best reviews of any Crowes album since The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. Guitarist Marc Ford was fired from the Black Crowes in August, 1997; two years later, the group returned with By Your Side. In mid-2000, the band collaborated with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page on the double-disc Live at the Greek, an eclectic mix of newly recorded Zeppelin covers and additional classic blues cuts. A Tribute to a Work in Progress: Greatest Hits 1990-1999, a 16-track best-of compilation was also released in mid-2000. The Don Was-produced Lions appeared in spring 2001, and a summer tour with Oasis -- the Tour of Brotherly Love -- followed in June. But all was apparently not well with the group, in January of 2002 the band announced that they were on hiatus. Drummer Steve Gorman was fired from the band, and Chris Robinson announced his intentions for a solo career.\n\nThe Black Crowes have since reunited.  All members circa 1992 are back, with the addition of one of their previous bassists, Sven Pipien, and harmony singers Mona Lisa Young and Charity White.  They are enjoying a renaissance within the group as well as with their longtime fan base and have been consistently touring since formally reuniting in March 2005.  In November of 2007, it was announced that North Mississippi Allstar guitarist Luther Dickinson formally joined the band, replacing Paul Stacey. He appears throughout the Crowes' album Warpaint, which was released in March of 2008.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Black+Crowes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "\nIn This Moment is a alternative metal band, formed in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, United States in 2005. Their first album, entitled Beautiful Tragedy, was released on March 20th, 2007 on Century Media Records. The band's sound falls on the melodic side of the metalcore spectrum, with vocalist Maria Brink utilizing both screams and a good deal of clean, emotive singing, the latter being even more prominent on the band's second album, The Dream, released in 2008. Their third studio album was released on July 2010 named A Star-Crossed Wasteland  \n\nBand History\nIn 2005, singer Maria Brink and guitarist Chris Howorth met through some common friends. After becoming acquainted they found there was much in common between the two and began writing songs. Soon thereafter they enlisted the help of Los Angeles drummer Jeff Fabb. By mid-2005, the lineup included Brink, Howorth, Fabb, guitarist Blake Bunzell, and bassist Josh Newell. The band recorded demos and posted them on Myspace, where they generated a large internet following. During the summer of 2005, Newell departed from the band to focus on his other project, Ketaset, as well as his sound engineering work. A close friend of the band named Pascual Romero (of Tinhorn) took over bass duties for a short time before Jesse Landry was given the position, and the band found its permanent lineup. By the end of the year, In This Moment had generated such a large following due to diligent internet marketing and \"do-it-yourself\" touring, they sparked an interest from Century Media Records. A worldwide record deal followed. Jesse Landry departed from the band because he wanted to live his true dreams. Fly Planes. Kyle Konkiel Replaced him. \n\nIn May 2011, In This Moment posted on Facebook that they are working on new material for a new album hoping for a 2012 release. This new release was recorded without founding members Jeff Fabb and Blake Bunzel, who are both working with James Durbin as of September, 2011. Blood will be the first album since the band have parted ways with longtime manager, Blasko. Blood was revealed to be the album's title on April 6, 2012. On May 14, 2012, it was announced that the album will be released on August 14, 2012. \"Blood\" was released as the album's first single on June 12, 2012. The album artwork and track listing for Blood were released on June 18, 2012. New members include Travis Johnson on Bass, Randy Weitzel on Rhythm Guitar and Tom Hane on Drums.\n\nIn This Moment announced on February 5, 2014 that they had left their Century Media Records label that had produced their previous four studio albums and signed a new deal with Atlantic Records. They also said that they are set to enter the studio on February 23 to record their fifth studio album and follow up their break out album \"Blood,\" released in 2012. Chris Howorth says, “We have a bunch of ideas and the way we did ‘Blood’ was different than we’d done any album before. We brought ideas and pieces and parts into the studio and wrote each song in the studio, one at a time. All the other albums we had the songs formatted and together already. So we’re going to do the same thing again. We’re gonna try to replicate the magic of ‘Blood’ and try to take the style and sound we had for ‘Blood’ and just do it bigger and better while still keeping true to that same vibe. That’s our sound. We feel like we found something and want to stick the flag in the ground on top of that hill. \n\nOn the 18th of November 2014, In This Moment released Black Widow, debuting at number 8, their highest position in the charts to date. Their sixth album, Ritual, was released in the summer of 2017.\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.inthismomentofficial.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/In+This+Moment\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Maren Morris is a singer and songwriter whose music bridges the gap between hard country, classic rock, and hip-hop-influenced pop; she has enjoyed success as both a tunesmith and a performer. Morris was born in Dallas, Texas on April 10, 1990 and grew up with a love of music, saying she was always willing to belt out a tune on the family's karaoke machine by age ten. By the time she was 14, she had learned to play guitar and began playing professionally, self-releasing a debut album, Walk On. Morris had struck a deal with Smith Music Group when she dropped her second album, 2007's All That It Takes; her songwriting was strong enough that she either wrote or co-wrote eight of the album's 13 tracks. Morris graduated high school and was attending the University of North Texas when she self-released her third full-length, 2011's Live Wire. A year later, she left Texas for Nashville, determined to shift her career into high gear.After winning an \"Artist on the Verge\" prize at the New Music Seminar, Morris got her foot in the door as a songwriter, signing a publishing deal with Yellow Dog and writing tunes for Tim McGraw (\"Last Turn Home\") and Kelly Clarkson (\"Second Wind\"). In addition, she ramped up her touring schedule, sharing stages with artists as diverse as Pat Green, Radney Foster, and Marty Stuart, and performing for artists in Europe and the United Kingdom as well as the United States. In 2015, Morris released a digital single titled \"My Church,\" about the close connection between music and driving. The song became a viral hit, generating over 2.5 million streams in a little over a month. The major labels in Music City took notice, and Morris signed a deal with Sony Music Nashville, which dropped a five-song EP featuring \"My Church\" in November 2015. Sony pushed \"My Church\" to country radio in anticipation of her full-length debut Hero, which appeared in June of 2016. The album hit number one on the country charts, and earned Morris a lot of attention: She was nominated for several Grammy awards, won CMA's New Artist of the Year, and earned a slot on Saturday Night Live late in 2016. In early 2017, she toured (both as a headliner and with Sam Hunt), and released a deluxe edition of Hero that included several bonus tracks. In October, Morris, in collaboration with Vince Gill, delivered the powerful single \"Dear Hate,\" which was written in response to the mass shooting at Las Vegas' Route 91 Harvest Festival, a stage that she had played the night before that attack. January 2019 saw Morris issue the empowerment anthem \"Girl,\" the first single from her newly released sophomore effort. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Maren+Morris\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The Head and the Heart is a folk band which formed in 2009 in Seattle, Washington, United States. The band consists of Josiah Johnson (vocals, guitar), Jonathan Russell (vocals, guitar), Charity Rose Thielen (violin, vocals), Chris Zasche (bass), Kenny Hensley (keyboards) and Tyler Williams (drums).  Composed primarily of transplants to the Seattle area, The Head and the Heart write and play songs that speak to the newness of a fresh start, of the ghosts left behind, of moving forward, all brimming with a soulfulness and hope for a better life than the one we've all been sold.  Stylistically, think a folksy Beatles or The Avett Brothers with a little extra oomph. Catchy piano melodies stand side by side with a tight trio of harmonies, and solid minimalist drums, groovin' bass, and plenty of hand percussion and foot stomps make the live show inspiring and really goddamn fun.  After the band self-released its eponymous debut album in June 2010, the emblematic Seattle label Sub Pop re-released the album. For the Sub Pop version, the song “Sounds like Hallelujah” has been re-recorded, live favorite “Rivers and Roads” has been added, and the album has been re-mastered. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Head+and+the+Heart\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": " Death Cab for Cutie is an American indie rock band formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1997. The band consists of Ben Gibbard (vocals, guitar, piano), Nicholas Harmer (bass), Jason McGerr (drums), Dave Depper (guitar) and Zac Rae (keyboards).  Death Cab began as a solo project of Ben Gibbard, now the band's vocalist and guitarist. Gibbard took the band name from the satirical song Death Cab for Cutie, performed by The Bonzo Dog Band in The Beatles' 1967 experimental film Magical Mystery Tour. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords; the release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the band into a complete project. He recruited Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as an electric guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass guitarist, and Nathan Good to play drums.   The four released the LP Something About Airplanes on August 18th 1998. The album was favorably reviewed in the independent music scene, and in 2000 the band released We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes. Nathan Good left the band at some point during this album's production. His playing on “The Employment Pages” and “Company Calls Epilogue” were kept, but Gibbard played drums on all other songs.  Michael Schorr would first appear on The Forbidden Love E.P., released on October 24, 2000. In 2001, another LP was released, entitled The Photo Album. Limited editions of this album contained three bonus tracks, which were later released separately as The Stability EP.  In 2003, there was another change of drummer, with Jason McGerr of Eureka Farm replacing Schorr. McGerr would play drums on the next release, Transatlanticism.  Transatlanticism was released in October of 2003. It received critical praise and also became the band's top-selling album, with 225,000 copies sold during its first year out.  In spring of 2004, the band recorded a live E.P. titled The John Byrd E.P., named for their sound engineer. The E.P. was released on Barsuk Records in March 2004.  In November of 2004, Death Cab for Cutie signed a “long-term worldwide deal” with Atlantic Records, leaving their long-time label Barsuk Records. Gibbard stated on the official website www.deathcabforcutie.com that nothing would change except that “Next to the picture of Barsuk holding a 7\", there will be the letter \"A\" on both the spine and back of our upcoming albums.” This was a marked change from Gibbard's earlier views on major-label relations, which he said “are set up to fuck you and take all your money.”. After signing to Atlantic, the band was still nervous about corporate economics, and encouraged fans to download its songs from the Internet.  The first and second singles off the band's Atlantic Record release Plans were “Soul Meets Body” and “Crooked Teeth”, respectively. The full album was released in August of 2005. Plans was somewhat well-acclaimed by critics and fans, and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album of 2005. It achieved Gold Status in 2006 after charting on Billboard for 47 consecutive weeks.  The band released a touring DVD titled Drive Well, Sleep Carefully in 2005. Known for their contributions to animal rights, the band is supporting the activist group PETA in giving away copies of the DVD to promote animal rights.  In early 2006, the band announced the upcoming release of Directions, eleven short films inspired by songs from the Plans album, each directed by a different person. The videos were posted one at a time at the band's website and the DVD went on sale April 11, 2006.  On May 12, 2008 their album, Narrow Stairs, was released  and was well received by both critics and fans. It was their first album to reach #1 on the Billboard 200. The album contains the singles \"I Will Possess Your Heart\", \"Cath...\" and \"Grapevine Fires\".  The band's latest released The Open Door EP, which was released on March 31, 2009. Their main styles consist of slow progressive rock with dark lyrics.  The band's seventh album, Codes and Keys, was released on May 31, 2011. The album's first single was \"You Are A Tourist\".  On October 11, 2013, the band reportedly began working on their eighth studio album. This was then confirmed by the group's official Instagram profile in which an image was uploaded with the caption \"DCFC LP8 begins\". The new album will be produced by Rich Costey and is expected to be released in early 2015. In an interview with Stereogum, Gibbard said of the new album, \"I do think from start to finish it's a much better record than Codes And Keys. If that record turned anybody off, I feel pretty strongly that this one could win them back. There are threads in this one that connect back to our earliest stuff that people love.\" On October 29, 2013, the band released a remastered tenth-anniversary version of their 2003 album Transatlanticism. The new album included a vinyl LP and MP3 download, with demos for all the songs from the album.  As part of the 2014 Record Store Day, the band released its first live album, a vinyl-only double LP recorded during various 2012 tour dates with Magik*Magik Orchestra. Included within the packaging was a code for a digital download of the recording.  On August 13, 2014, after 17 years as a member of Death Cab for Cutie, guitarist and songwriter Chris Walla decided to part ways with the band, with his last performance occurring on September 13, 2014 at the Rifflandia Music Festival in Victoria, British Columbia. Walla states that he plans to \"...continue making music, producing records, and erring on the side of benevolence and beauty whenever possible.\" When asked in an interview about Walla's involvement in the eighth album, McGerr confirmed that Walla \"played on everything and has been involved all the way through, even in the mixing. Even though he's played his last show with us, he's still been involved in everything involving this record.\"    <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Cab+for+Cutie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Her second album, Feels Like Home, with folk tendency, is the highest-selling album in the history of Blue Note Records with over a million copies sold within the first week. Norah Jones was listed among the most influential people of 2004 by the Time Magazine.  On January 30, 2007 Norah Jones released her third album, Not Too Late - a collection of 13 original songs, itunes includes a bonus live track of the song Sinkin' Soon. This was the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon.com.  Her fourth studio album, The Fall, was released on November 17, 2009.  Her fifth studio album ...Little Broken Hearts was released on May 1, 2012 and she collaborated with Danger Mouse for its production. The Happy Pills Songfacts reports that the album was recorded at Danger Mouse's Los Angeles studio during the fall of 2011. The record was co-written by Jones and Danger Mouse, with the pair handling the majority of the instrumentals. Jones teamed up with the producer after she contributed vocals to his Rome project with Daniele Luppi.  The daughter of Beatles-influencing sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar, Jones doesn't closely follow any particular genre, rather she brings her unique jazzy flavor to songs with roots in country, folk, Americana, and modern light jazz, pop and rock.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Norah+Jones\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The String Cheese Incident (SCI) is a US jam band formed in Crested Butte, Colorado in 1993. The band's music has elements of bluegrass as well as rock, electronica, calypso, country, funk, jazz, Latin, progressive rock, reggae, and occasional psychedelia. All members write original compositions and sing.  From playing local gigs at ski resorts in exchange for free lift tickets, the band is composed of Michael Kang (acoustic/electric mandolin, electric guitar, and violin), Michael Travis (drums and percussion), Bill Nershi (acoustic guitar, lap steel guitar, and electric slide guitar), Kyle Hollingsworth (piano, organ, Rhodes, and accordion), and Keith Moseley (bass guitar), and, in 2006, Jason Hann (auxiliary percussion).  The String Cheese Incident has been described as a democratic ensemble rather than a band, since all of the members contribute their own original compositions to the group’s burgeoning library and share the vocal burden on a number of cover versions as well as their own songs. If a de facto leader had to be named, such a title would probably fall upon Nershi, who is responsible for the bulk of the group’s original song library.  From their management, Madison House Inc.:  \"The String Cheese Incident has emerged as one of America’s most significant independent bands. Born in 1993 in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, SCI has since released 6 albums, 3 DVDs and countless live recordings from their relentless tour schedule. Their 14 year history is packed full of surreal experiences, epic moments, groundbreaking involvement and huge accomplishments. They have been recognized for their commitment to musical creativity and integrity, for their community spirit, philanthropic endeavors, and for their innovative approach to the business of music.    When The String Cheese Incident’s growth first started gaining momentum over a decade ago, when the internet was just beginning to take hold and the major-label business model was failing, the band decided to make music on their own terms.    Since then, The String Cheese Incident has gone on to carve out a completely different approach to the business of music; they are truly pioneers of a new way of “making a band.”  With the World Wide Web as their tool, SCI was among the first artists to disseminate information via the internet, such as tour dates, release information, and other news, to their growing fan base.  Rather than doing business on such terms as “the bottom line,” The String Cheese Incident put their music and their fans first, opening companies of their own, including a ticketing company, a merchandise company and a fan travel agency, to best serve their community. The band’s record label, SCI Fidelity Records, has always operated under the same ideals. Even early on, SCI Fidelity embraced downloadable music and file sharing, delivering SCI’s “On the Road” series, where every show the band plays is made available for download on the internet.  Whether they realized it at the time or not, The String Cheese Incident was inventing grassroots band development.  Today, literally hundreds of bands are using some version of this same approach to building a band.     The String Cheese Incident’s commitment goes well beyond their immediate community, and even beyond the music community as a whole. Early on, the band took a serious interest in giving back to the communities that they visited, and they were among the first performers to encourage “Green” shows and tours.  SCI’s support has helped give rise to such not-for-profit organizations as Conscious Alliance, Rock the Earth, and Head Count. In 2002, when the band’s right to sell tickets to their own shows became threatened by ticketing giant Ticketmaster, the band stood strong for the independent music community and filed a lawsuit against the company.  All the while, The String Cheese Incident has stayed committed to music as a creative endeavor, not just in their recordings but also in their live performances.  The list of SCI’s special guests and collaborators is long and diverse. Their annual events such as Horning’s Hideout, and holiday shows such as New Year’s and Halloween, have helped redefine the concert experience and has garnered the band a reputation as live music vibe innovators.\"  Some side groups are eoto, zilla with Jamie Janover, Zuvuya, Honkytonk Homeslice, Billy nershi's Plue Planet, Pangaea, The Trancident & Keller Williams with Moseley Droll and Sipe  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+String+Cheese+Incident\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Pink Martini is a 13-member \"little orchestra\" from Portland, Oregon, formed in 1994 by pianist Thomas Lauderdale. They draw inspiration from music from all over the world – crossing genres of classical, jazz and old-fashioned pop.  Pink Martini has twelve instrumentalists (and sometimes travels with string sections), and performs its multilingual repertoire on concert stages and with symphony orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Northern Africa, Australia and New Zealand and North America. Pink Martini made its European debut at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997 and its orchestral debut with the Oregon Symphony in 1998 under the direction of Norman Leyden. Since then, the band has gone on to play with over 30 orchestras around the world, including multiple engagements with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the Boston Pops, the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center and the BBC Concert Orchestra in London. Other appearances include the grand opening of the Los Angeles Philharmonic’s new Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, with return sold-out engagements for New Year’s Eve 2003, 2004 & 2008; two sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall; the opening party of the remodeled Museum of Modern Art in NYC; the Governor’s Ball at the 80th Annual Academy Awards in 2008; and the opening of the 2008 Sydney Festival in Australia.  Lauderdale met China Forbes, Pink Martini’s lead vocalist, at Harvard. He was studying history and literature while she was studying English literature and painting. Late at night, they would break into the lower common room in their college dormitory and sing arias by Puccini and Verdi – and the occasional campy Barbra Streisand cover –thus sealing their creative collaboration. Three years after graduating, Lauderdale called Forbes who was living in New York City, where she’d been writing songs and playing guitar in her own folk-rock project, and asked her to join Pink Martini. They began to write songs together for the band. Their first song “Sympathique”– with the chorus “Je ne veux pas travailler” (”I don’t want to work”) – became an overnight sensation in France, and was even nominated for “Song of the Year” at France’s Victoires de la Musique Awards. Forbes, though fluent only in English, sings in 15 different languages.  Pink Martini’s debut album Sympathique was released independently in 1997 on the band’s own label Heinz Records (named after Lauderdale’s dog), and quickly became an international phenomenon, garnering the group nominations for “Song of the Year” and “Best New Artist” in France’s Victoires de la Musique Awards in 2000.  In October 2004, the group released its second album, Hang on Little Tomato.  In May 2007, it released its third album, Hey Eugene!.  A fourth studio album, Splendor in the Grass, followed on October 27, 2009. Sympathique, Hang on Little Tomato and Hey Eugene! have all gone gold in France, Canada, Greece and Turkey; collectively, Pink Martini's records have sold more than two million copies worldwide.  On New Year's Eve 2005, Pink Martini performed live at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland, Oregon. This performance was aired live on National Public Radio's Toast of the Nation, and in partnership with Oregon Public Broadcasting was recorded for a live DVD and later broadcast on US public broadcasting and French television.[citation needed] The DVD has been rereleased to retail as Discover the World: Live in Concert, featuring not only the full concert, but several vignettes and a short documentary of the band's history.  The band has collaborated and performed with Jimmy Scott, Carol Channing, Henri Salvador, Jane Powell, Chavela Vargas, Georges Moustaki, Michael Feinstein, DJ Dimitri from Paris, clarinetist and conductor Norman Leyden, Hiroshi Wada, DJ Johnny Dynell and several drag queens from New York City, among others. On June 1, 2007, the band appeared on the long-running BBC Two Later with Jools Holland TV music program. On June 14, 2007, Pink Martini performed on Late Show with David Letterman, performing \"Hey Eugene\".  Pink Martini played Walt Disney Concert Hall on New Year's Eve for the first two years it was open (2003/4 and 2004/5). They returned to play NYE there again in 2008/9.  In May 2009, the band recorded three concerts with the Oregon Symphony under the direction of Carlos Kalmar for the band’s fifth album … a symphonic record which is slated for a 2011 release.  Pink Martini songs appear in such films as In the Cut, Nurse Betty, Josie and the Pussycats, Tortilla Soup, Shanghai Kiss, Mary and Max, and Mr. & Mrs. Smith and have been used on television shows such as Dead Like Me, The Sopranos and The West Wing, among others.[citation needed] Their song \"Una notte a Napoli\" is an integral part of the Italian movie Mine Vaganti (2010), by the Italian-Turkish director Ferzan Özpetek. The song \"No Hay Problema\" is included as background/setup music for Microsoft's Windows Server 2003 and was also used as the background/setup music for an early build of Windows Longhorn, now known as Windows Vista.[citation needed] In February 2011, the group's lead singer, China Forbes, recorded a video greeting to the European Space Agency's Italian astronaut, Paolo Nespoli, and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Kaleri, on board the International Space Station. The astronauts were preparing to oversee the docking of ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) cargo vessel, Johannes Kepler, which took place at 17:08 CET on 24 February. The greeting was set to the sound track of Dosvedanya Mio Bombino - one of Pink Martini's signature songs - and was mixed with footage of the actual docking.  In November 2011, they played at the Balboa Theater with the Bonita Vista High School band, Club Blue.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Martini\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The String Cheese Incident (SCI) is a US jam band formed in Crested Butte, Colorado in 1993. The band's music has elements of bluegrass as well as rock, electronica, calypso, country, funk, jazz, Latin, progressive rock, reggae, and occasional psychedelia. All members write original compositions and sing.  From playing local gigs at ski resorts in exchange for free lift tickets, the band is composed of Michael Kang (acoustic/electric mandolin, electric guitar, and violin), Michael Travis (drums and percussion), Bill Nershi (acoustic guitar, lap steel guitar, and electric slide guitar), Kyle Hollingsworth (piano, organ, Rhodes, and accordion), and Keith Moseley (bass guitar), and, in 2006, Jason Hann (auxiliary percussion).  The String Cheese Incident has been described as a democratic ensemble rather than a band, since all of the members contribute their own original compositions to the group’s burgeoning library and share the vocal burden on a number of cover versions as well as their own songs. If a de facto leader had to be named, such a title would probably fall upon Nershi, who is responsible for the bulk of the group’s original song library.  From their management, Madison House Inc.:  \"The String Cheese Incident has emerged as one of America’s most significant independent bands. Born in 1993 in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, SCI has since released 6 albums, 3 DVDs and countless live recordings from their relentless tour schedule. Their 14 year history is packed full of surreal experiences, epic moments, groundbreaking involvement and huge accomplishments. They have been recognized for their commitment to musical creativity and integrity, for their community spirit, philanthropic endeavors, and for their innovative approach to the business of music.    When The String Cheese Incident’s growth first started gaining momentum over a decade ago, when the internet was just beginning to take hold and the major-label business model was failing, the band decided to make music on their own terms.    Since then, The String Cheese Incident has gone on to carve out a completely different approach to the business of music; they are truly pioneers of a new way of “making a band.”  With the World Wide Web as their tool, SCI was among the first artists to disseminate information via the internet, such as tour dates, release information, and other news, to their growing fan base.  Rather than doing business on such terms as “the bottom line,” The String Cheese Incident put their music and their fans first, opening companies of their own, including a ticketing company, a merchandise company and a fan travel agency, to best serve their community. The band’s record label, SCI Fidelity Records, has always operated under the same ideals. Even early on, SCI Fidelity embraced downloadable music and file sharing, delivering SCI’s “On the Road” series, where every show the band plays is made available for download on the internet.  Whether they realized it at the time or not, The String Cheese Incident was inventing grassroots band development.  Today, literally hundreds of bands are using some version of this same approach to building a band.     The String Cheese Incident’s commitment goes well beyond their immediate community, and even beyond the music community as a whole. Early on, the band took a serious interest in giving back to the communities that they visited, and they were among the first performers to encourage “Green” shows and tours.  SCI’s support has helped give rise to such not-for-profit organizations as Conscious Alliance, Rock the Earth, and Head Count. In 2002, when the band’s right to sell tickets to their own shows became threatened by ticketing giant Ticketmaster, the band stood strong for the independent music community and filed a lawsuit against the company.  All the while, The String Cheese Incident has stayed committed to music as a creative endeavor, not just in their recordings but also in their live performances.  The list of SCI’s special guests and collaborators is long and diverse. Their annual events such as Horning’s Hideout, and holiday shows such as New Year’s and Halloween, have helped redefine the concert experience and has garnered the band a reputation as live music vibe innovators.\"  Some side groups are eoto, zilla with Jamie Janover, Zuvuya, Honkytonk Homeslice, Billy nershi's Plue Planet, Pangaea, The Trancident & Keller Williams with Moseley Droll and Sipe  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+String+Cheese+Incident\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Trampled By Turtles (TBT) is an indie folk band from Duluth, Minnesota. The group is most famous for both its fast-paced songs and plaintive ballads. Their high-energy concerts have attracted an ever-growing, dedicated fan following. The band members have referenced inspirations such as Townes Van Zandt, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ralph Stanley. Their fifth release, Palomino, has maintained a position in the Top 10 on the Billboard bluegrass charts for 52 straight weeks. Their music has been featured in TV shows including Deadliest Catch and Squidbillies. Their sixth studio album, Stars and Satellites, was released on April 10, 2012.  The band has performed at many national festivals including Coachella, Stagecoach, Summerfest, Bumbershoot, and Pickathon. In 2011, they performed at several large folk festivals such as Telluride Bluegrass Festival, Newport Folk Festival and 2011 ROMP roots and branches. They are scheduled to play the Sasquatch Festival, Bonnaroo, All Good Music Festival, Newport Folk Festival, and Lollapalooza in 2012.  2014 saw the release of Trampled by Turtles's seventh studio album, Wild Animals, on July 15th. The band tapped Alan Sparhawk, from the band Low, to produce Wild Animals. Sparhawk's influence is evident in the band's seemingly more alternative, high lonesome sound. The night of Wild Animals' release, TBT made their second appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman. On August 16th, Trampled by Turtles headlined a sold out show at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, CO.  http://www.trampledbyturtles.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Trampled+by+Turtles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.  The band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek & Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.  After the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.  The collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track \"Space Captain\" with additional members of Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks & Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform \"Space Captain\" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.  On 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.

    "headlinerBio": "   Blues Traveler is a rock band, formed in Princeton, New Jersey in 1987. The band's music covers a variety of genres, including blues rock, psychedelic rock, folk rock, soul, and Southern rock.     Currently, the group comprises singer and harmonica player John Popper, guitarist Chan Kinchla, drummer Brendan Hill, bassist Tad Kinchla and keyboardist Ben Wilson. Tad Kinchla and Ben Wilson joined the band following the death of original bassist Bobby Sheehan in 1999.    While Blues Traveler is best known among fans for their improvisational live shows, the general public is most familiar with the group from their Top 40 singles \"Run-Around\" and \"Hook\". They gained mainstream popularity after their fourth studio album four, released in 1994. Sheehan's death and Popper's struggle with obesity put a damper on the group's success, and A&M dropped the band in 2002.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Blues+Traveler\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Widespread Panic is a rock band which formed in Athens, Georgia, United States in 1986. The band currently consists of John Bell (vocals, guitar), Jimmy Herirng (guitar), Dave Schools (bass), John \"JoJo\" Hermann (keyboards), Domingo \"Sunny\" Ortiz (percussion) and Todd Nance (drums). The band has previously included Michael Houser (guitar) and George McConnell (guitar) and have released 11 albums.  Michael Houser and John Bell ('JB') met at the University of Georgia at Athens between 1982 and 1984, and began playing music together around town as a duet. JB played solo shows as well. In the Fall of 1984, David Schools saw JB play a solo show at Abbots in Athens. Dave and JB were introduced by a mutual friend. Shortly thereafter, JB & Mike recruited Dave to play bass with them, and from Mike's nickname (\"Panic\"), the band name Widespread Panic was chosen. On February 24, 1985 the band played their first performance as Widespread Panic at the A-Frame house on Weymanda Court in Athens. Mike, JB, & Dave performed around Athens as a trio, occasionally utilizing local drummers. While their shows consisted primarily of cover tunes (by the likes of The Grateful Dead, Van Morrison, Bob Marley, and Traffic, among others), their repertoire did include a handful of original songs: Sleepy Monkey (the band's first original composition), Chilly Water, Space Wrangler, and Coconut (written by JB before joining the band). During this time, the trio also met vocalist Kelly Jo Davis (who is later married to blues guitarist and friend of WP, Tinsley Ellis). Kelly Jo performed frequently with the band throughout 1985 and 1986.  February 6, 1986, Mike recruited high school friend/band mate Todd Nance for a WP gig (an Aid For Africa benefit) at the Mad Hatter Ballroom in Athens, opening for Strawberry Flats (featuring John Keane). This is considered the first \"official\" Widespread Panic show. Todd evidently had a good time, and accepted their offer to join the band. On February 9, 1985, Mike, Dave, and JB, with Joel Morris on drums and Kelly Jo Davis on backing vocals, recorded Monkey Image (Sleepy Monkey) and Coconut Image (Coconut) at Panoramic Recording Studio in Arnoldsville GA, to be released as their first single. The 45rpm vinyl was released (in a pressing of only 500) shortly thereafter on the band's Space Baby label.  During the rest of 1986, WP played mainly in Athens, though they did branch out to venues in Macon, GA and South Carolina. Early on, they began playing every Monday night at the Uptown Lounge in Athens, a tradition that would last well into 1988. Along the way, they developed a solid batch of original tunes (in addition to the four originals that they played in 1985), including Stop-Go, C. Brown, Tie Your Shoes, Porch Song, Driving Song, Conrad, Vacation, Postcard, the instrumental Machine, and another instrumental jam that JB later adds lyrics to, titled Cardboard Box. On October 6, 1986, Texan percussionist Domingo S. Ortiz (\"Sunny\"), sat in with the band at the Uptown Lounge for the first time. Sunny continued to perform with the band on numerous occasions in Athens, Macon, and Atlanta, and eventually (late 1988 or early 1989) accepted the band's request for him to join as a full-time member.  During 1987, WP continued to play primarily in Georgia, while steadily spreading out to SC, NC, AL, TN, and as far north as Richmond, VA (Dave Schools' hometown). They developed a few more originals along the way, including Barstools & Dreamers, Contentment Blues, I'm Not Alone, and instrumentals L.a. (aka \"Liza's Apartment\"), and The Take Out. JB added lyrics to Cardboard Box, and to another instrumental titled \"Puppet Song\", subsequently renamed Pigeons. Cardboard Box was only played a handful of times before being dropped from the repertoire. In the Fall, the band signed with Landslide Records and recorded their first album, Space Wrangler, at John Keane's Studio in Athens. Guests on the album included Sunny on percussion, David Blackmon on fiddle, Tim White on keyboards, and Alberto Salazarte (of Athens band White Buffalo) on percussion.  In June of 1988, the first known guest appearance of producer John Keane on stage with the band occurred. Usually playing pedal steel, Keane became another regular guest at special Panic shows.  Their debut LP, Space Wrangler, established a small fan base and inaugurated several years of constant touring before the band signed to Capricorn Records and released their major label debut, Widespread Panic in 1991. After appearing with the H.O.R.D.E. tours for a few years, the band became one of the most popular new jam bands that arose in the mid-1990s. Their popularity peaked in the late 1990s/early 2000s, as their concert draw benefited from Phish's temporary hiatus. They still have a large draw in the South, where they are most popular.   Playing as many as 250 shows a year, Panic built a large fan base. True road warriors, Widespread Panic ranked among the top 50 grossing touring acts for eight years running, even without substantial radio airplay, television exposure, or promotion at retail stores. The band holds sellout records at Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver (23 shows), Oak Mountain Amphitheatre near Birmingham, Ala. (17 shows), Philips Arena in Atlanta (11 shows), and UNO Lakefront Arena in New Orleans (18 shows). Not to mention 20 sellouts at San Francisco's Warfield Theatre, seven sellouts across the Bay at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, nine sellouts at Mud Island in Memphis, seven at Memphis' Mid-South Coliseum, and in October 2003 for the popular Halloween shows sold out two concerts at New York's famed Madison Square Garden. To celebrate the release of their first live album, Light Fuse, Get Away, Widespread Panic offered a free \"CD release party\" concert in the streets of hometown Athens. An estimated 100,000 fans descended on the town, transforming it into the largest CD release party in history.  In August 2002, founding guitarist Michael Houser lost his battle with pancreatic cancer. George McConnell, a long time friend of the band and former Beanland,a Mississippi roots band, member joined in Houser's wake. After Hermann had joined Panic in 1992, McConnell often sat in whenever Panic played in the south. Friends for the past 15 years, Panic and McConnell had often played on the same bill for nearly as long. That longstanding relationship made him the natural choice to continue on with Panic after Michael Houser's death from pancreatic cancer in August of that year. \"It's all about chemistry,\" Schools said. \"We've been friends for 15 years.\" At the end of the summer tour, Panic went back to the studio to record Ball, a testament that, as Houser wished, they would continue as a band.  On August 2, 2006, the band announced that George McConnell would no longer be playing with the band. John Keane, friend and co-producer of many of the bands albums, provided guitar support for the remainder of the tour, along with Sam Holt. Both had been featured contributors in Widespread Panic concerts since the beginning of the Summer 2006 tour. The following day, the band announced that guitarist Jimmy Herring, who had previously been a member of the 1990s band the Aquarium Rescue Unit and had toured with The Allman Brothers Band and members of The Grateful Dead, would join the band, beginning with the first show of the Fall 2006 tour at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York.  The band has sold over 3 million albums, and released a total of 15 CDs and five DVDs (including Live at Oak Mountain, which is certified Gold).   In June 2006, their 9th and most recent studio album, Earth to America, was released. Earth to America was recorded with Terry Manning in Nassau, Bahamas at the beautiful Compass Point Studios.   In late 2006, Fayetteville, NC native Jimmy Herring took over the reins of the lead guitarist in the band, kicking off their fall tour with three nights at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York.  Panic’s 7th annual New Year’s shows on December 30 and 31 of 2007, marked their 15th and 16th sellout performance at Philips Arena.  The band released their 10th album, Free Somehow, on February 12, 2008. It, too, was recorded with producer Terry Manning at Compass Point Studios.  Following the release of the new studio album, Widespread Panic began to release vintage concert performances from the Widespread Panic Archives. Carbondale 2000 was released on June 10, 2008, followed by Valdosta 1989 released on February 24, 2009, and Huntsville 1996 released on June 23, 2009. The band will continue to dig into their show archives, which encompasses the past 25 years, and release these shows as multi-track recordings.  June 27, 2008, marked the band's 32nd sold-out show at Red Rocks Amphitheater. This was more than any other band in the venue's history. Mayor John Hickenlooper proclaimed Friday, June 27 \"Widespread Panic Day\" in the City and County of Denver. The same year, Widespread Panic was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame on September 20.  The band continued to tour throughout the rest of 2008 and the spring of 2009. In the summer of 2009, Widespread Panic teamed up with fellow southern rockers, The Allman Brothers to do a summer and fall co-headlining tour.  In March 2010, it was announced that Widespread Panic would be releasing a new album entitled Dirty Side Down on May 25, 2010. The band is also releasing Live in the Classic City II, containing music from its 2000 shows.  On September 29, 2010, Widespread keyboardist Jojo Herman announced that the band would be going on hiatus in 2012. In an interview with the Vanderbilt Hustler, Herman explained, \"Next year will be our 25th anniversary. After that, we're probably going to call it (quits) for awhile. So we're looking forward to next year and going out on a high note.\"    <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Widespread+Panic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "John Prine (born October 10, 1946 in Maywood, Illinois) is an American country/folk singer-songwriter who has achieved widespread critical (and some commercial) success since the early 1970s.  The son of William Prine and Verna Hamm, his grandfather had played guitar with Merle Travis and he started playing guitar himself at 14 years old. He was a postman for 5 years and spent a couple of years in the army before starting his musical career in the Chicago area. He emerged in 1971 with a highly acclaimed debut album titled John Prine. He and friend Steve Goodman (another folk singer-songwriter) had been minor stars in the Chicago folk scene before being \"discovered\" by Kris Kristofferson. The album John Prine included his signature songs \"Illegal Smile\", \"Sam Stone\", and the environmentalist newgrass standard \"Paradise\". The album also included \"Hello In There\", a song about aging that was later covered by Joan Baez, Bette Midler, and Eddi Reader, and \"Angel From Montgomery\", a song now also associated with Bonnie Raitt, who occasionally brings Prine on-stage with her for live performances of the song. The album received many positive reviews, and some hailed Prine as \"the next Dylan\". Bob Dylan himself appeared unannounced at one of Prine's first New York City club appearances, anonymously backing him on harmonica.  Later albums include Sweet Revenge (1973, containing such Prine fan favorites as \"Dear Abby\", \"Grandpa Was A Carpenter\", and \"Christmas In Prison\"), and Common Sense (1975, with \"Come Back To Us Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard\").  In 1991 Prine released the Grammy Award-winning  The Missing Years, his first collaboration with producer and bassist Howie Epstein. The title song records Prine's humorous take on what Jesus did in the unrecorded years between his childhood and his ministry. In 1995 Prine released Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings, another collaboration with Epstein. In 1997 Prine followed with In Spite of Ourselves, which was unusual for Prine in that it contained only one original song; the rest were covers of classic country songs. All were collaborations with Prine's favorite female country vocalists, including Lucinda Williams and Iris DeMent.  In early 1998 Prine was diagnosed with throat cancer, but survived after an operation to remove the tumor and this has added gravel to his voice. In 2003 he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award for songwriting by the UK's BBC Radio 2 and that same year was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. The following year saw his classic \"Sam Stone\" covered by Laura Cantrell for the Future Soundtrack for America compilation.  In 2005, Prine released his first all-new album since In Spite of Ourselves. This new album, Fair and Square, tends toward a more laid-back, acoustic approach than, for example, Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings. The album contains songs such as \"Safety Joe\", about a man who has never taken any risks in his life, and also \"Some Humans Ain't Human\", Prine's protest piece on the album, which talks about the ugly side of human nature and includes a quick shot at President George W. Bush. Fair and Square won the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album.  The 2005 Americana Music Awards marked another significant achievement for Prine. At the September 9th ceremony, Prine was honored with the Artist of the Year award, which was accepted in his name by awards host and long-time friend Billy Bob Thornton. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/John+Prine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Emerging onto the Southern California music scene with a sound as original as the band members themselves, the Dirty Heads’ blend of hip-hop and classic reggae rips through the sonic surf with bold beats, fun rhythms and the relaxed vibe of feel-good lyrics.  Rooted in the Orange County community of Huntington Beach, California, founding band members Jared Watson and guitarist / vocalist Dustin Bushnell met in 1996 while in high school, embarking on a friendship based on music, as well as their shared passion for surfing, skating and the endless party of the laid-back SoCal lifestyle.  Early on, they spent many late nights jamming in Bushnell’s soundproof garage with a four-track recorder, writing unique acoustic hip-hop songs that featured reggae inflections. Inspired by the rock and reggae sounds of Bob Marley, Sublime, 311 and The Beastie Boys, the band’s music evolved into their distinct Dirty Heads style.  To complete the Dirty Heads’ sound, the duo added percussionist Jon Olazabal and drummer Matt Ochoa, both talented, experienced musicians. With a set of solid material, the Dirty Heads were further motivated to take their craft to the next level, and they began building a loyal fan base throughout the west coast, while performing acoustically at local bars and small music venues. As they started playing in neighboring Los Angeles, the band found it necessary to charter party buses so their fans could make the 30-mile trek to their shows.  Connecting with sought-after producers Steve Fox and Stan Frazier (Sugar Ray / Ashlee Simpson) the band worked long hours to polish their material and further develop their style. The Dirty Heads also recruited mixing engineer Mario Caldato Jr., best known for his work with the Beastie Boys, to add the finishing touches and create just the right blend.  The band’s highly-anticipated first full-length album is entitled, Any Port in the Storm (Released on EMG through Fontana, a division of Universal Music Group Distribution - September 2008). This debut features 14 tracks that are reminiscent of the upbeat, sun-soaked Southern California party energy. The first single is the optimistic, “Stand Tall.”  Any Port in the Storm also features one of the final recordings of the late music industry icon Billy Preston. Frequently referred to as “The Fifth Beatle,” Preston played on three tracks, including “Stand Tall,” “Chelsea,” and “Driftin.’ ” Other special guests on the album are drummer Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle, Sting, The Vandals), and veteran session percussionist Alex Acuna, whose A-list musician resume includes Peter Gabriel, Johnny Clegg, and Jackson Browne, to name only a few.  Recently, the band’s music has been attracting attention throughout the world of entertainment. Their songs have been featured in the movie and soundtrack for Surf’s Up (Sony 2007); and the television drama, Shark staring James Woods (CBS 2007. Actor Matthew McConaughey selected the band’s music to be in his upcoming film, Surfer Dude. In addition, the Dirty Heads can be heard in Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam video game (Activision 2007), and several other music compilations and surf/skate videos. On the marketing side, the Dirty Heads have also been included in campaigns for Etnies Jeans and Vestal Watches.  Dirty Heads vocalist Jared Watson sums up their fun, uncomplicated style, “We want to be positive and entertain,” he says. “We just want to make you feel good.”  And who can’t dig that?  www.dirtyheads.com www.myspace.com/dirtyheads <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dirty+Heads\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Hauldren manned the turntables as Haul Pass, while Kennett produced under the moniker Fatboy. After meeting on March 18, 2012 at a Madeon concert, the pair decided to join forces and start making music together, even though Kennett was wrapping up high school and Hauldren had just enrolled at the University of Southern California. They titled their debut EP Dimensions and would release a series of singles -- \"It's Strange\" with K.Flay, \"Weekend\" with Icona Pop, and \"Fire\" with Evalyn -- in the years that followed. In addition to opening for Madeon in 2015, they also toured with the Chainsmokers, whose own brand of pop-minded electronic music mirrored Louis the Child's radio-friendly anthems. In 2016, the duo collaborated with New Orleans rapper Pell as Pellican Child, releasing the single \"Turn Me Down\" from a joint EP that would arrive in 2017. That year, Louis the Child also released their Love Is Alive EP, a versatile set that featured the title track with guest vocalist Elohim, and \"Phone Died\" with rapper Blaise Railey. Months later, they collaborated with Love Is Alive guest vocalist Ashe for another track, \"Right to It.\" 2018 saw the duo team up with Aussie singer/songwriter Wafia for \"Better Not,\" and Motor City singer Quinn XCII for \"The City.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Louis+The+Child\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Brantley Gilbert (born January 20, 1985), is an American country rock music singer-songwriter. He has released two albums, both on the Average Joe's Entertainment Group label. His songs have also been recorded by Colt Ford and Jason Aldean. In February 2011, he left Average Joe's label to join Valory Music Group, where he has charted \"Country Must Be Country Wide\". A deluxe edition of Halfway to Heaven was released on September 13, 2011, two months before \"Country Must Be Country Wide\" reached number one on the Hot Country Songs charts.\n\nThe Country Must Be Country Wide Songfacts reports that Gilbert's debut album, Modern Day Prodigal Son was originally set to be released in 2006 but the label dropped him before it hit stores. After signing with Average Joe's entertainment in mid 2009, the album finally saw the light of day a few months later. Gilbert signed with Big Machine Records' Valory Music Group division in February 2011, and his new label will be re-releasing Modern Day Prodigal Son on August 23, 2011.\nThe album contains Country Must Be Country Wide, which is his third single and his first to reach both the Country chart and the Hot 100.\n\nBrantley Gilbert knows that tomorrow is no guarantee. Just over five years ago the talented singer/songwriter was ignoring his deepest ambition of becoming a country singer and was just going through the motions of everyday life. It wasn’t until a nearly-fatal car accident that Brantley opened his eyes, realized the importance of living each day to the fullest, and decided to pursue his love for music as a career.\n\nBrantley was born and raised in the small town of Jefferson, Georgia, just outside the Athens city limits. It is that upbringing and small town influence Brantley credits toward allowing him to cultivate his unique sound. With well-known rock bands REM and the B-52’s having roots nearby, Brantley’s taste in music always swayed toward a rock feel, but his true-to-life testimony of heartache, trials, triumph, and success found a home in country music.\n\nAfter taking the stage night-after-night with just his guitar and opening for other country artists throughout the southeast, Brantley began to notice familiar faces in the crowds. A group of believers who shared Brantley’s passion for life and music had developed, and pretty soon the following had taken-on a life of its own. Brantley quickly realized that his acoustic shows—however intimate—didn’t satisfy his audience’s thirst for his rock-infused country music. In order to meet their demand, Brantley formed a band.\n\n“We went from these acoustic shows to a bona fide country-rock-soul show that is wide-ass open,” says Gilbert. “Even when we play a ballad it’s high energy.”\n\nWith the fans demanding new music from Brantley, he came to Nashville, Tennessee where he soon signed with Warner Chappell Publishing and began to develop music for a debut album release. One of his songs, “The Best of Me,” was recorded by Jason Aldean and earned a spot on his Walmart exclusive release (WIDE OPEN) and ITunes. Since, Brantley has signed a record deal with Average Joe’s Entertainment and collaborated with top-charting act and labelmate Colt Ford to write and record, “Dirt Road Anthem,” which is currently featured on Ford’s multiple-week Top 25 Billboard album, RIDE THROUGH THE COUNTRY.\n\n“I’ve realized that life can be very short, and everyone should take advantage of it,” he said. “If you’re gonna live, do something with it. Make it great.”\n\nAnd great it is. Brantley celebrates the release of his sophomore album, HALFWAY TO HEAVEN, in March 2010 leading off with the single “Kick It In the Sticks.” HALFWAY TO HEAVEN follows his 2009 release, A MODERN DAY PRODIGAL SON, which features hit singles, “G.R.I.T.S.” and “Whenever We’re Alone.”\n\nAs tour dates multiply throughout the South, Brantley’s fan base continues to expand, and like most artists these days, fans can stay updated about tour dates and news via MySpace. His page garners more than 25,000 listeners daily— a number that has brought him to the #1 spot on MySpace Music Charts for both country and southern rock. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brantley+Gilbert\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their third to eighth albums—Float Along – Fill Your Lungs (2013), Oddments, I'm in Your Mind Fuzz (2014), Quarters!, Paper Mâché Dream Balloon (2015) and Nonagon Infinity (2016)—expanded their sound, including elements of film music, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, folk, jazz, soul and heavy metal.\n\nIn 2017, the band fulfilled a promise to release five studio albums within the year: Flying Microtonal Banana in February; Murder of the Universe in June; Sketches of Brunswick East, a collaboration with Mild High Club, in August; Polygondwanaland, which was released into the public domain, in November; and Gumboot Soup in December. The band released its fourteenth album, Fishing for Fishies, on 26 April 2019, followed by a fifteenth album, Infest the Rats' Nest, released on 16 August that year.\n\nThe band members all grew up and went to school in the Deniliquin, Melbourne and Geelong areas. The band started off as a group of friends jamming together, before a mutual friend asked them to play at a show. The band's name was created \"last minute\". Mackenzie wanted to name the band \"Gizzard Gizzard\" while another band member wanted Jim Morrison's nickname \"Lizard King\". They eventually compromised with King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. The artist Jason Galea has created all of the band's album art, and a majority of their music videos. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/King+Gizzard+&+The+Lizard+Wizard\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Trampled By Turtles (TBT) is an indie folk band from Duluth, Minnesota. The group is most famous for both its fast-paced songs and plaintive ballads. Their high-energy concerts have attracted an ever-growing, dedicated fan following. The band members have referenced inspirations such as Townes Van Zandt, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ralph Stanley. Their fifth release, Palomino, has maintained a position in the Top 10 on the Billboard bluegrass charts for 52 straight weeks. Their music has been featured in TV shows including Deadliest Catch and Squidbillies. Their sixth studio album, Stars and Satellites, was released on April 10, 2012.\n\nThe band has performed at many national festivals including Coachella, Stagecoach, Summerfest, Bumbershoot, and Pickathon. In 2011, they performed at several large folk festivals such as Telluride Bluegrass Festival, Newport Folk Festival and 2011 ROMP roots and branches. They are scheduled to play the Sasquatch Festival, Bonnaroo, All Good Music Festival, Newport Folk Festival, and Lollapalooza in 2012.\n\n2014 saw the release of Trampled by Turtles's seventh studio album, Wild Animals, on July 15th. The band tapped Alan Sparhawk, from the band Low, to produce Wild Animals. Sparhawk's influence is evident in the band's seemingly more alternative, high lonesome sound. The night of Wild Animals' release, TBT made their second appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman. On August 16th, Trampled by Turtles headlined a sold out show at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, CO.\n\nhttp://www.trampledbyturtles.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Trampled+by+Turtles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Rick Springfield (born Richard Lewis Springthorpe on 23 August 1949) is an Australian singer-songwriter, musician, and actor. A member of the pop rock group Zoot from 1969 to 1971, he had an initial career as a charismatic 'teen idol'; he started his string of solo works with a debut single, called \"Speak to the Sky\", that reached the top 10 in Australia. In mid-1972, he relocated to the U.S., evolving into a more strident new wave and power pop sound as the years passed. Respected a serious musician while also having a huge following, he had a #1 hit with \"Jessie's Girl\" in 1981 in both Australia and the U.S.\n\nHe received the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for \"Jessie's Girl\", which proved to be a career breakout moment. He followed with four more top 10 U.S. rock hits: \"I've Done Everything for You\", \"Don't Talk to Strangers\", \"Affair of the Heart\", and \"Love Somebody\". His two U.S. top 10 albums are 1981's 'Working Class Dog' and 1982's 'Success Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet', releases featuring an energetic sound earning both commercial and critical successes. As an actor, he portrayed the popular Dr. Noah Drake on the daytime drama 'General Hospital' from 1981 to 1983, and he sprang back into the role during 2005 to 2008 and 2012, returning again in 2013 for the show's 50th anniversary with his son (and fellow actor) Liam Springthorpe.\n\nThough having gigantic success in the early to mid-80s, Springfield felt totally exhausted with the pressures of stardom. He would end up devoting more time to his personal and family life, though still releasing albums through the late 80s and onward. In 2010, Springfield published his well-received autobiography, titled 'Late, Late at Night: A Memoir', which detailed these struggles.\n\nBorn Richard Lewis Springthorpe, later adopting \"Rick Springfield\" in his performing days, in South Wentworthville on 23 August 1949, he spent the early part of his life around the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia. The son of Eileen and Norman Springthorpe, the latter a Australian Army career officer, he also has an older brother, Mike Springthorpe. Due to his father's Army career, the Springthorpe family moved to London, England, where they lived between 1960 to 1962. The family moved back to Australia in June 1962, where they settled in the Melbourne suburb of Ormond.\n\nInspired by the 60s pop rock boom around him, the young Rick Springfield took naturally to singing and songwriting. However, commercial success would come in sudden bursts for him, with the performer facing bouts of 'teen idol' worship (even spending a time doing music for kids as a sort of cartoon Mister Rogers from 1973 to 1975, with those songs put into his 'Mission Magic!' album) that concealed his desire to be taken seriously as a musician. Fully embracing a power pop and new wave sound, as played by contemporaries such as Cheap Trick, The Cars, and others, finally helped him hit the big time in a dramatic way. As well, in October 1984, Springfield married his longtime girlfriend, Barbara Porter, in his family's church in Australia.\n\nWhen being interviewed about his autobiography, Springfield admitted that he dated while married, and that it was a problem that he has overcome. He mentioned in particular dating Linda Blair, Demi Moore, Connie Hamzy, Morgana Welch, and Geraldine Edwards (the inspiration for Penny Lane in 'Almost Famous'). Though on top of the world for a time, things proved unstable and uncertain. In 1985, when his first son was born and after the release of his 'Tao' album, Springfield took a break from his musical career to spend more time with his family, as stated before. He also resolved to deal with the off-and-on depression that had affected him since his adolescence. Springfield had suffered much in the 70s due to both the serious illness of his father, who died on 24 April 1981, and difficulties dealing with people in the music industry.\n\nRecently, a new feature documentary, titled 'An Affair of the Heart: The Journey of Rick Springfield and his Devoted Fans, was filmed in 2010. The movie started on the film festival circuit in the spring of 2012. The performer's latest work is 2015's 'Stripped Down', a combination of covers, new material, and re-recorded tracks from his past that has attracted some critical praise. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rick+Springfield\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With catchy, yet deep lyrical meaning, beautifully designed bass lines, and melodic guitar riffs, their unique sound will keep you humming their tunes all day long. The Alternative/Indie-Pop band takes influence from great artists like Modest Mouse, Lana Del Rey, and Kings of Leon.\n\nRKS was formed in early 2013 when the first two members, Sam Melo and Darrick \"Bozzy\" Keller, decided to begin writing and composing music together. What started out as just two college students with acoustic guitars, would soon turn into a full band with a uniquely controversial name.\n\nAfter recording RKS's first EP \"Mary\" in an old dorm room on the campus of Appalachian State University, the duo decided to take it up a notch by adding more members and instruments to the band. Over the next year the group widely expanded in size and sound by adding three more members: Ethan Goodpaster (Electric Guitar), Jess Haney (Drums), and Charlie Holt (Bass). In that year, RKS independently released their first album \"Seven\" (Which was later re-released in combination with the band's first EP as a joint album titled \"Seven + Mary\"). The title song, \"Seven\" has been featured in many places on the web including in the very popular podcast by IGN, Podcast Beyond! The song \"Devil Like Me\" and it's music video earned the band a spot in VH1's \"Make A Band Famous\" contest where they made it to the final 24 out of thousands of artists from across the US.\n\nThe group's main interest is producing a quality, unique, and fresh sound for all music lovers to listen to and enjoy. Their new album \"RKS\" is now available on iTunes & Spotify <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rainbow+Kitten+Surprise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Born Grant Kwiecinski in Southfield, Michigan in 1990, he began playing alto saxophone and piano as a youth, and dropped out of Michigan State University in order to pursue a career as a musician. His debut album, End of the World Party, was released in 2011 by Mochipet's Daly City label, and its sample-heavy downtempo tracks made a splash online. The saxophone-wielding musician began supporting popular touring electronic acts such as Bassnectar and Pretty Lights, leading to his own successful headlining tours. His self-released second album, Mad Liberation, appeared in 2012, followed by the more socially conscious Rebel Era in 2013. His fourth album, 2015's Say It Loud, featured numerous guest vocalists (including Talib Kweli and Ivan Neville) and an increased presence of live instrumentation, working toward more of a vintage funk sound while remaining contemporary. GRiZ stuck with the organic funk approach for 2016's Good Will Prevail.

Armed with turntables, a killer vibe and an open mind, Alison turns countless dance floors across Australia into your favourite kind of Wonderland: more beats, less croquet.\n\nBeginning with a background in indie and classical, Wonderland's best card is her eclecticism. Throughout her youth she toured Europe as a principal cellist for the Sydney Youth Orchestra and later played bass in a successful local indie band.\n\nAfter inking a global deal with EMI, Wonderland released her debut compilation record - \"Welcome To Wonderland\" mid 2012, while her much anticipated first original's album is due out very soon! If the success of her remixes is anything to go by the record is set to be a game changer.\n\nWonderland has performed in LA at the official Grammy's Afterparty, all throughout Ibiza on top of MOS and the Brit Awards Afterparty in London. In Australia she has torn up main stages at Splendour in the Grass, Falls Festival, Southbound Festival, Stereosonic, Field Day, Parklife (nationally), Good Vibrations Festival, Harbourlife, Sydney Fashion Week, Future Music Festival, Coaster Festival, Secret Garden Festival and more, not to mention her sellout headline national tours.\n\nThe end of 2012 saw Wonderland taking the highly prestigious summer festival time slots. Playing main stage at Falls Festival in a headline slot after Hot Chip to a capacity crowd, Supporting PNAU Live at Wonderland Festival in Perth & again destroying the headline time slot after SBTRKT to a heaving tent at Southbound Festival this all within 1 WEEK!\n\nWonderland is the party, rumour has it she never sleeps and is reasonably good friends with Oprah. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alison+Wonderland\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Good music is felt not heard. Gramatik apparently understood that at an age of 3 according to his mother as she used to catch him glued to the radio in his older sister's room whenever there was an old funk or rhythm & blues joint on, tapping his leg on the floor along with the beat. Damn, talking about a sign on what will your child do when he grows up!\n\nParents got him taking piano lessons in the elementary music school when he was in 2nd grade, but he dropped out 2 years later because he wasn't feeling that whole classical music thing as that was the only genre they were teaching. He later got some private piano lessons, learning the stuff he wanted to learn to play like Beatles and Rhythm & Blues in general. He and a few of his 4th grade classmates formed a band and became the youngest band in the history of his elementary school, playing school events on the regular. When he got to 7th grade he discovered Hip-Hop and felt totally overtaken and compelled by it's elements, especially by the power of the rhythmically accented poetry(RAP). He soon left the band, started writing and became an MC. His friends were amazed by his flow and delivery since there were no hip-hop artists in his home town Piran(Slovenia) at the time, except him and one of his classmates and they were dope on top of it! They formed a duo called Bow Down and threw the first hip-hop party in the history of their home town. In 1998, Gramatik met his first audio sequencing software on the computer of his classmate's older brother and felt like he got struck by lightening, totally overwhelmed by it! His parents were financially struggling at the time, so they couldn't afford a computer, so he was hanging out at his friend's house all the time, messing around with the sequencer when his older brother wasn't home. 2 years later his parents bought him a computer and the first thing he did was install that audio sequencer! He started producing his first beats and day by day felt more and more compelled by the craft & the magic of it. It wasn't long untill he discovered sampling which became his one true love in the music making process, chopping up all those old funk, soul, blues and jazz tracks he used to listen to all the time and making something completely new out of it was the best feeling ever. All of a sudden his life started to make perfect sense.\n\nIn 2006, he and 2 of his friends, fellow MC's, released their debut hip-hop album as a group called 5th Element, which was critically acclaimed throughout the country as one of the best hip-hop albums in Slovenia. After the album, Gramatik felt hip-hop just wasn't enough, that he was limiting himself with doing only one genre while he enjoyed listening to so many of them so he started producing House, Techno, Breakbeat, Electro, Drum'n'Bass, basically any genre that he liked which was anything that evolved from Blues, Jazz, Soul and Funk, as those ''father genres'' were all embedded deep in his style, whatever he would do. He realized that to him, music is much bigger than a genre name and their specific categorization, it's all about embracing what moves you and rejecting what doesn't. He released his first ever track on Beatport.com in june 2008, which was an Electro House track, a remix he did for DJ Vitamin D's track entitled Motherfuckers Know Whos The Best. The track ended up 24 on the Electro House Top 100 chart, a nice surprise and an excellent quality validation for this newcomer. Soon after that he ended up on 40 of the House Top 100 chart with his tribal banger Letz Get Ill while his Dreams About Her EP topped the Chil Out top 100 chart for 3 weeks. He kept releasing different stuff on various labels all owned by DJ Vitamin D which he became good friends with. Not long after his first release stroke the chart, Vitamin D suggests to him that he should scrap up those 20 hip-hop beatz he had sitting in a flash player on his myspace for over 2 years and release them as an album on the new Chill Out/Trip-Hop/Instrumental Hip-Hop label he's about to open inspired by those same beatz he was listening to. So Gramatik does that(thinking he won't sell more than 3 tracks off the album since they were just 2:30 minuets long hip-hop beatz, which are not commonly sold on beatport) and the album he entitled Street Bangerz Vol.1 get's released in december 2008 on the fresh new label Cold Busted. little did he know that the album was gonna catapult straight to the 1 spot on the Top 100 Chill Out chart and has been holding hostage the first 20 spots ever since. Street Bangerz Vol.1 has been a total success, completely unexpected, selling over 50.000 tracks world wide in less than 6 months on beatport alone. It made him realize that quite often, the things that you expect to work the least, usually work the most. Gramatik is now working on various projects while determined to keep up the SB series, dropping one a year, perfecting them volume after volume and hopefully tour the world in due time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gramatik\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard are an Australian psychedelic rock band that formed in 2010 in Melbourne, Victoria. The band consists of Stu Mackenzie (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, flute), Ambrose Kenny-Smith (vocals, harmonica, keyboards), Cook Craig (guitar, bass, vocals), Joey Walker (guitar, bass, keyboards, vocals), Lucas Skinner (bass, keyboards), Michael Cavanagh (drums, percussion), and Eric Moore (drums, percussion, management). They are known for their energetic live shows and prolific recording output, having released two EPs and 15 studio albums since their formation.\n\nTheir EP and first two albums, Willoughby's Beach (2011), 12 Bar Bruise (2012) and Eyes Like the Sky (2013), primarily blended surf music and garage rock, and were released on the band's independent record label, Flightless, founded by Moore in 2012. Their third to eighth albums—Float Along – Fill Your Lungs (2013), Oddments, I'm in Your Mind Fuzz (2014), Quarters!, Paper Mâché Dream Balloon (2015) and Nonagon Infinity (2016)—expanded their sound, including elements of film music, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, folk, jazz, soul and heavy metal.\n\nIn 2017, the band fulfilled a promise to release five studio albums within the year: Flying Microtonal Banana in February; Murder of the Universe in June; Sketches of Brunswick East, a collaboration with Mild High Club, in August; Polygondwanaland, which was released into the public domain, in November; and Gumboot Soup in December. The band released its fourteenth album, Fishing for Fishies, on 26 April 2019, followed by a fifteenth album, Infest the Rats' Nest, released on 16 August that year.\n\nThe band members all grew up and went to school in the Deniliquin, Melbourne and Geelong areas. The band started off as a group of friends jamming together, before a mutual friend asked them to play at a show. The band's name was created \"last minute\". Mackenzie wanted to name the band \"Gizzard Gizzard\" while another band member wanted Jim Morrison's nickname \"Lizard King\". They eventually compromised with King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. The artist Jason Galea has created all of the band's album art, and a majority of their music videos. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/King+Gizzard+&+The+Lizard+Wizard\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "If you're familiar with bluegrass music, then you're tuned in to some of what Greensky Bluegrass does. They're also known to throw a great party, rock n roll, and (if the critics are to be believed) they have great songs. They are unquestionably a team of friends that traverse the country making music they enjoy. What makes Greensky different than Bluegrass? Poignant rural ballads about real people? Dobro tone that Jerry (Douglas or Garcia) would love? Distortion Pedals? Grit and attitude from a whiskey soaked card game? Indeed, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThis quintet from Michigan has been staying up late at all the coolest festivals and stopping to play your favorite clubs and theaters across America for 11 years now. Nearly 175 shows per year has prepared them for the rigorous task of continuity. Greensky Bluegrass isn't slowing down. \"They're coming to your town to help you party down.\" Yeah. Really. Like you never thought possible.\n\nAt the start of the millenium,some of these guys met, then they met more guys. They thought Greensky was a clever name for a bluegrass band. Fast forward to 2011 when they recorded their fourth studio record, called Handguns. Among them, words like, \"proud,\" \"killer,\" and \"damn right!\" have been spoken in regards to the music of Handguns.\n\nWhile they all may be accurate, we hope you'll find far more than you expected, hell - even more than we expected contained in this piece work that may well come to define one of 21st Century America's hardest working musical ensembles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Greensky+Bluegrass\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Michael Franti (born April 21, 1967 in Oakland, CA) is a gifted and much-heralded spoken word artist and political activist from San Francisco, CA. As leader of the politically and socially-charged group Spearhead, Franti is at the forefront of hip-hop's renaissance, expanding the music's boundaries as he draws on funk and soul-driven beats. Through his music and poetry, Franti tackles a range of issues--the criminal justice system, corporatization of our daily lives, AIDS, gay rights, homelessness, the death penalty, drug addiction and suicide.\n\nHis project Spearhead produced the critically acclaimed Home in 1994. The album contained his biggest single, \"Hole in the Bucket,\" a thoughtful lament on the plight of the homeless, and \"Positive,\" which addressed the growing AIDS epidemic. The album boasted adept funk samplings, sinuous guitar vamps, and soulful, melodic tracks about family and social injustice. 1997's Chocolate Supa Highway was not as pop-friendly as Home, but neither did its themes of kidnappings and police brutality lend themselves to such overt accessibility. Its mixture of harsher musical styles -- techno, rock, and funk -- was a step forward for Franti as his world view broadened and deepened. In 2001, Franti released Stay Human. In it he expresses his anger at the system, his advocacy of love, and his belief in freedom through individuality and self-expression through a set of songs that revolve around a fictitious death penalty case. In it, his embrace of the genres that inspired him is achieved with eloquence. \n\nEarlier projects of Franti include The Beatnigs and The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, which had more of an experimental/industrial sound, but addressed many of the same social/political issues.\n\nAs a celebration of the Election of Barack Obama Franti recorded the Obama Song, offered as a free track on downloaded at their offical website, www.michaelfranti.com/.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Franti+&+Spearhead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Big Head Todd & the Monsters is a rock band formed in 1986 in Colorado. The band has released eight studio albums since 1989 with their 1993 album Sister Sweetly going well beyond platinum in the US. The band has developed a sizeable live following especially in the Mountain States of the US. \n Big Head Todd and The Monsters – singer-guitarist Todd Park Mohr, bassist-singer Rob Squires, drummer-singer Brian Nevin and keyboardist-guitarist-singer Jeremy Lawton --  could have begun resting on their laurels back in 1993, when their Top 10 singles “Bittersweet,” “Broken Hearted Savior,” “Circle” and “It’s Alright” pushed the album Sister Sweetly to platinum certification. However, Mohr says, “I’ve fought throughout our career not to be a one-trick pony, to be the kind of band that has depth and diversity in its catalogue. I’m a fan of this band, and I’m constantly looking forward to what comes next.”\nThe essence of Big Head Todd and The Monsters – a rootsy, emotionally direct variety of rock ’n’ roll that lends itself particularly well to a live setting – has been winning fans since Mohr, Rob Squires and Brian Nevin started playing together in high school (Jeremy Lawton joined in 2004). Needless to say, the three never expected to be in the same band at this late date, but, as Mohr points out, “It was a really fortunate combination of musical personalities, and we’re still partners in every sense of the word.”\nThe band spent seven years developing their chemistry and amassing a following, boosted significantly by the independent releases Another Mayberry (1989) and Midnight Radio (1990), before being “discovered” by the listening public at large with 1993’s Sister Sweetly. After a major-label stint (Sister Sweetly, 1994’s Stratagem, 1997’s Beautiful World), during which the trio increasingly found itself frustrated artistically, they reclaimed their independent status (2001’s Riviera, 2004’s Crimes of Passion). “If it were not for our ability to do things for ourselves, we would have disappeared a long time ago,” Mohr allows.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Head+Todd+and+the+Monsters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

At Lake Huron, he developed songs for the first Lord Huron EP. He named the recording, Into the Sun. Upon his return to L.A., Schneider set to work putting a band together. The first to join him was his percussion-playing childhood friend Mark. Each of the band members of band hail from Michigan.\n\nInto The Sun and Mighty\nLord Huron released two EPs in 2010, Into the Sun and Mighty. Pop & Hiss, the LA Times Music Blog, described Mighty as \"full of lush acoustic guitars and Midwestern-accented harmonies as warm as a winter fireplace, but it's the Caribbean-influenced percussion that fans Lord Huron's folk sound into flame,\"and Pitchfork could only classify it as \"a stylistic superball, bouncing off any wall you put around it.\" NPR's World Cafe wrote \"the band's lush harmonies are backed by a hazy whirlpool of polyrhythmic tropical drums and folk guitars.\"\nDespite the fact that Schneider played all of the instruments on both EPs, he has gathered a band for live performances, which have also gotten positive reviews. \"The totality of the experience was like being on hand for a combination drum circle, chamber performance, and Calypso street party,\" wrote LA Weekly.Some of the larger shows the band has performed at include Lollapalooza (2011) and Outside Lands (2011), as well as a marathon ten shows in four days at the SXSW (2011) music festival.\n\nDiscography\n\nEPs\nInto The Sun (2010)\nMighty (2010)\nTime to Run (2012)\n\nLPs\nLonesome Dreams (2012)\nStrange Trails (2015)\nVide Noir (2018)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lord+Huron\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Stick Figure is a reggae band from California. All music is created by singer Scott Woodruff. Until 2009 he lived in Duxbury, Massachusetts, as Stick Figure all alone. After a long trip to NZ and Bali, he 2011 moved to San Diego to put together a band. 2012 he released the 5th Stick Figure album, Burial Ground. It reached no. 1 on iTunes and Billboard Reggae charts, and has songs as 'Breathe' and 'Weight Of Sound (feat. TJ O'Neill) '. The band then toured in USA with other reggae groups. (Rebelution, The Green, Passafire, Tribal Seeds, The Expendables). The 6th album, Set In Stone (2015) included collaborations with Collie Buddz (the song 'Smokin’ Love (ft. Collie Buddz)'). Also with Eric Rachmany and Slightly Stoopid. Again they topped Billboard Reggae Albums Chart.\n_   _   _\n\nPossessing a unique style of music that combines a creative blend of upbeat roots reggae with the reverberating echoes of dub, comes a man with no limit for his musical abilities. Stick Figure's music is written, recorded, and produced by Scott Woodruff, a young man from Duxbury, MA.\n\nAll of Stick Figure's songs are made by recording each instrument separately, layering several tracks on top of one another in unison.\n\nStick Figure recently relocated to Southern California and has picked up three new members for the live band, Brendan Dane (San Diego) on bass, Todd Smith (San Clemente) on drums and Kevin Bong (San Diego) on keys. All are incredible musicians and are surely a great addition to the Stick Figure sound. The band is currently in the process of recording their first debut album together, expecting to drop this Winter.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stick+Figure\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "O'Shea Jackson Sr. (born June 15, 1969), known professionally as Ice Cube, is an American rapper and actor. He began his career as a member of the hip-hop group C.I.A. and later joined the seminal rap group N.W.A (Niggaz Wit Attitudes). After leaving N.W.A in December 1989, he began both a successful solo music career and an acting career which included roles in films such as Boyz n the Hood (1991), Friday (1995), for which he also co-wrote the screenplay, and Barbershop (2002). Additionally, he has served as one of the producers of the Showtime television series Barbershop and the TBS series Are We There Yet?, both of which are based upon films in which he portrayed the main character.\n\nIce Cube is one of the founding artists of gangsta rap, and much of his musical output has contained harsh socio-political commentary. He was ranked number 8 on MTV's list of the 10 Greatest MCs of All Time, while fellow rapper Snoop Dogg ranked Ice Cube as one of the greatest MC of all time. AllMusic has called him one of hip-hop's best and most controversial artists, as well as \"one of rap's greatest storytellers\". In 2012, The Source ranked him number 14 on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time. In 2014, About.com ranked him number 11 on their list of the \"50 Greatest MCs of All Time\"\n\nHe released his solo debut album, \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted,\" in 1990 to critical and commercial success, although upon its release he was accused of racism and misogyny. He has since released 1991's \"Death Certificate\", 1992's \"The Predator\", 1993's \"Lethal Injection\", 1998's \"War & Peace Vol 1 (The War Disc)\", 2000's \"War & Peace Vol 2 (The Peace Disc)\", 2006's \"Laugh Now, Cry Later\", 2008's \"Raw Footage\", and 2010's \"I Am the West.\"\n\nIce Cube was raised in South Central by his parents, both of whom were employed at UCLA. He began writing raps while attending William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California, most notably \"Boyz 'N Tha Hood\", which later became famous when done by N.W.A in 1986. \n\nCube and a friend, Sir Jinx, rapped as a partnership called C.I.A. at parties hosted by Dr. Dre. After a brief stint in a group called \"HBO\", Cube showed Eazy-E \"Boyz 'N Da Hood,\" and the pair, plus Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, The Arabian Prince and MC Ren, formed N.W.A. \n\nCube took one year off to earn a degree in architectural drafting in Phoenix in 1987 but returned in time to participate in N.W.A's debut album, Straight Outta Compton. The album attracted much notoriety for the group, from the FBI and concerned citizen and parent groups. Cube did the lead verse for the album's infamous track \"Fuck tha Police.\"\n\nIce Cube left N.W.A due to financial and personality conflicts in 1989. With Da Lench Mob and the Bomb Squad (Public Enemy's producers), Cube recorded his debut album in New York City. AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted was released in 1990 and was an instantaneous hit as rap's popularity increased in mainstream society. \n\nHis 1991 follow-up, Death Certificate, was even more controversial. A few songs in the album featured Cube's hate of Uncle Sam and his politics, and a bonus track named \"No Vaseline\" was a diss to his former N.W.A bandmates. Also that year, he converted to the Nation of Islam. The album was re-released in 2003 with the bonus track \"How to Survive in South Central,\" originally from the 1991 \"Boyz N the Hood\" soundtrack.\n\nControversy stirred about racist lyrics in his material: \"Black Korea\" (a song against Korean shopowners), referring to a former boss as \"white Jew\" in \"No Vaseline\", and songs such as \"Enemy and Cave Bitch\" (songs against \"devils\", a popular derogatory term at the time for white people). Partially to help deflect criticisms, Cube appointed a female rapper named Yo-Yo (who guested on AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted) to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, Make Way for the Motherlode. That was followed by a critically acclaimed turn in \"Boyz in the Hood\", a film by John Singleton\n\nCube toured on Lollapalooza in 1992 and widened his fan base. He released The Predator in November (1992) which debuted at #1 on both the pop and rnb charts, the first album in history to do so. For that album, Cube decided to load some G-funk style beats which at that time was the big thing and some remix tunes which brought a new style to Cube, in which previously he had released some hardcore and extreme work. Singles from The Predator included \"Today was a Good Day\" and \"Check Yo Self (remix)\" which all had a 2 part music video.\n\nAfter The Predator, Cube's audience began to diminish. Lethal Injection (1993) was not very well-liked by critics, and Dr. Dre and the West Coast G-Funk sound was dominating hip-hop. It wasn't until later that the album became popular. Taking a break from his own albums, Cube assisted on debuts from Da Lench Mob (Guerillas in the Mist) and Kam (Neva Again). He later dueted with Dr. Dre on \"Natural Born Killaz.\"\n\nAround this time in 1993, Ice Cube also worked with soon-to-be-acclaimed rapper Tupac Shakur with his album Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. and appeared on a track with 2pac.\n\nIn 1994 Ice Cube released Bootlegs & B-Sides.\n\nDuring this time, hip-hop started making a transition from the West Coast Funk Hip-Hop to a more gritty East Coast hip-hop. With Mack 10 and WC, Cube formed the Westside Connection in 1996, releasing their debut album Bow Down later that year. This album was in due to Ice Cube's theory that the East Coast lacked respect for West Coast hip-hop. Songs like \"Bow Down\", and \"Gangstas Make The World Go 'Round\" make reference to this. Sales were brisk, but it did not establish a large audience. This album was later perceived as a classic, especially on the West Coast. Cube released several more solo albums; however, he is now known more for his movies than his music.\n\nIn 1998 Ice Cube released War & Peace Vol 1: The War Disc\nIn 2000 Ice Cube released War & Peace Vol 2: The Peace Disc\nIn 2003 Ice Cube along with W.C. & Mack 10 released Terrorist Threats as the West Side Connection.\n\nIn December 2004, after a long break from recording, he reached #2 in the UK singles chart with the club favourite, \"You Can Do It\" (featuring Mack 10 and Ms Toi), released as a single 5 years after it was first included on movie soundtracks such as \nIce Cube was influenced by and took his name from African American pimp-turned-author Iceberg Slim, who published his autobiography Pimp in 1969. At one point, Ice Cube was scheduled to play the lead role in a movie adaptation of Pimp, but the project appears to be halted.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ice+Cube\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Tedeschi Trucks Band (formerly known as the Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band) is an American blues rock group based in Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.\n\nThe band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival, however this group's material was largely culled from Derek & Susan's solo projects, while the Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.\n\nAfter the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.\n\nThe collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock's album, The Imagine Project, performing the track \"Space Captain\" with additional members of Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks & Tedeschi's home studio.  Trucks and Tedeschi also appeared with Herbie Hancock to perform \"Space Captain\" at his 70th birthday concerts at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nOn 7 March 2011, the band announced that it was changing its name to the Tedeschi Trucks Band. The first Tedeschi Trucks Band CD, Revelator, will be released on June 7th 2011.\n\nSites: Discogs, YouTube and Facebook <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tedeschi+Trucks+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Vocalist and guitarist Rome Ramirez joined Wilson and Gaugh to perform classic material and eventually originals. It became clear that Ramirez could not replace Sublime's late lead singer and guitarist, Bradley Nowell, who died in 1996 but legally, he would simply be \"featured with\" former Sublime members. \n\nSublime with Rome performed their first gig together in February 2009 near Gaugh's home in Nevada, followed by an appearance at Cypress Hill's Smokeout Festival in San Bernadino that October. On April 20, 2010, the band embarked on their first-ever US tour with dates going into that fall. After positive reaction on the road, Sublime with Rome released a debut album on Fueled By Ramen records in July 2011. \n\nIn December 2011, Bud Gaugh revealed in an interview that he would be leaving Sublime With Rome and KROQ's Accoustic Christmas would be his last show. He saying he wanted to go home and spend more time with his family.  He later went on to say  \"It was really good for the first few months, after that, it just felt wrong. Not playing the songs but playing them with the name Sublime, without Brad.\" When asked if he saw the band reuniting in the future Gaugh replied \"No, I am done with SWR. I would be into playing music with Eric Wilson, however.\" He was replaced by Josh Freese. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sublime+with+Rome\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Gary LeVox and Jay DeMarcus were second cousins from a musical family. DeMarcus's brother-in-law, James Otto, is also a country music artist. DeMarcus moved to Nashville in 1992, earning his first record deal as part of a Christian group called East to West. In 1997, he finally convinced LeVox to leave behind his job with the Ohio Department of Mental Retardation and follow his musical dreams as well.\n\nDeMarcus soon joined Chely Wright's band, and there he met Joe Don Rooney. DeMarcus and LeVox were working in a Printer's Alley nightclub, and when their part-time guitarist could not make it one night, DeMarcus invited Rooney to sit in. Eventually, they took the name Rascal Flatts and began performing together, getting signed to Lyric Street Records in late 1999.\n\nThe band was recently announced that they have celebrated 10 years of being one of the hottest country bands of the decade. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rascal+Flatts\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Railroad Earth is a roots and Americana-based jamband from rural western Stillwater, New Jersey, USA. Their name stems from a Jack Kerouac poem \"October in the Railroad Earth,\" and the band has a song by the same name. Railroad Earth's music combines elements of bluegrass, rock and roll, jazz, celtic and more, and the group is known for its extensive live improvisation and lyrical songwriting within an acoustic base.\n\nThe band members, already accomplished musicians, first came together in early 2001. Originally comprised of guitarist/vocalist Todd Sheaffer, violinist/vocalist  Tim Carbone, mandolinist/vocalist  John Skehan, multi-instrumentalist/vocalist  Andy Goessling, drummer/vocalist  Carey Harmon, and bassist ]Dave Von Dollen, the group played both original compositions mostly written by Sheaffer, the former From Good Homes songwriter, as well as traditional songs. After just three weeks of rehearsals, they went into a local recording studio and tracked a five song demo. Recorded live with no overdubs except backing vocals, The Black Bear Sessions set Railroad Earth's career in motion. Within a week they had a manager on board who then sent their demo out to some of the country’s most prestigious festivals, quickly landing a slot at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. That was their tenth gig. The Black Bear Sessions was released to the public in June 2001, and following their appearance at Telluride Sugar Hill Records approached the band and offered them a record deal. The Black Bear Sessions contains some of the most popular songs in Railroad Earth's repertoire, including \"Seven Story Mountain\" and \"Head.\"\n\nIn June 2002, one year from the release of their debut, Railroad Earth’s second album, Bird in a House, came out on Sugar Hill Records, featuring songs such as \"Bird In A House,\" \"Like A Buddha,\" and \"Mighty River.\". The band continued its steady touring schedule, playing theatres, folk-music festivals, jam-band festivals, and other venues, while gathering much praise for its unique sound and enjoyable live concerts. The band eventually built up a fanbase who call themselves Hobos.\n\nIn 2003 Dave Von Dollen was replaced by bassist Johnny Grubb. In 2004 the band released its third studio effort, The Good Life, featuring \"Storms,\" Mourning Flies,\" and \"Goat.\" The band continued to tour throughout the country, and its first live album, Elko, was issued in late January 2006. They performed at the Austin City Limits Music Festival on September 15, 2007.\n\nThe band's fourth studio album, entitled Amen Corner, was released on June 10, 2008. The new album features songs such as \"Been Down This Road,\" \"Hard Livin',\" \"Waggin' The Dog,\" and \"Lovin' You\".\n\nOn November 11, 2009, Grubb announced his departure from the band after Railroad Earth's New Year's Eve run of shows in Portland, OR. In February 2010, Andrew Altman of the Codetalkers and Blueground Undergrass was named as his successor.\n\nThe band's self-titled fifth album was released on Oct 12, 2010. The album features Andy Goessling playing electric guitar for the first time, plus an 11-minute instrumental written by John Skehan entitled \"Spring-Heeled Jack\" (SHJ is John Skehan's initials backwards); the latter is the longest studio track to date for the band.\n\nAndy Goessling passed away in October 2018.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Railroad+Earth\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their \"funk for aliens\" will take you on a journey through classic funk, hip-hop, dub, disco, electronica, and afrobeat with hints of jazz and even film scores along the way. Since forming in January of 2008, this duo has gone from rocking local house parties to touring the country and performing alongside their musical heroes. And with nothing pre-recorded and nothing sampled, every show is a completely unique experience as they reach for new levels of improvisation. While The Floozies are certainly eclectic, one thing that can be counted on is that every show is a party. With lasers. And aliens. Their album, \"Live: Volume 1,\" is a testament to their unique musical approach.

    "headlinerBio": "Almost out of nowhere, Los Angeles’ Dillon Francis has broken from the throng of young electronic music dj/producers. With a stream of world-class remixes and releases, Dillon has caught the attention of some of the top players in club land, including Steve Aoki, Diplo, Will I. Am, Drop The Lime, Sinden, and Tittsworth, to name some. In less than a year his blistering productions have been heavily supported by Major Lazer, who opened their show with “Westside!,” a Dutch House-flavored monster that was consistently rinsed by top djs on both sides of the pond, including Sinden and Steve Aoki. The tune is finally seeing a proper release on Diplo’s Mad Decent label, where Dillon will be releasing his “Masta Blasta” EP as well in the near future.. From his first dubstep release on Play Me Records, the heavy “Take Me High” peaked at No. 13 on the Beatport dubstep chart and was played in full by Rusko in every one of his sets for his current OMG tour. In the coming months, Dillon will have releases on Mad Decent, Dim Mak, Top Billin’, as well as Plant Music, where he will be releasing his next club EP. At ease behind the turntables and in the studio, in the electro world and in dubstep, Dillon is what you would call an open-format electronic dj who sees no delineation between making music and playing it. He has gotten huge support from the most important dance music blogs (Dim Mak, Mad Decent, Discobelle, Gotta Dance Dirty) ever since releasing his first bootlegs last year, and 2011 promises to be Dillon’s breakout year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dillon+Francis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "New self-titled Pepper album drops Fall 2013!! \n\nFacebook www.facebook.com/pepperlive; Twitter www.twitter.com/pepperlive; Instagram www.instagram.com/pepperlive\n\nKaleo Wassman – Vocals/Guitar\nBret Bollinger – Vocals/Bass\nYesod Williams – Drums\n\n“It’s the hardest thing we’ve ever done as a band to make this record,” says guitarist/vocalist Kaleo Wassman of Pepper, in speaking on the recording process of their new self-titled album. “It speaks loudly and widely to a broader audience while maintaining everything good about the band, which, first of all, is our positive attitude.” After releasing five albums, Pepper has opened a new chapter in their storied career. Drummer Yesod Williams adds, “This record feels very cohesive in a way our past releases maybe didn’t. I think it’s an album that can appeal to everyone, as well.  We’ve been pigeonholed in the past so this is an opportunity to transcend all that and spread our wings even wider.” \n\nThe trio, who formed in 1997 and moved to the mainland from their hometown of Kailua Kona, Hawaii in 1999, pressed pause after the release of their fifth album, Pink Crustaceans and Good Vibrations, in 2008. There was a sense of fatigue and disunity amongst the three musicians, who took some time off from music both apart and together before rejoining to create an EP, Stiches, in late 2010. The songs on that release re-energized the group, revealing an urgent desire to make a new album that reflected where they are in their lives and career now. After some tour dates in support of the EP, Pepper sat down and focused on their sixth album, a self-titled released that swings open the door on this new chapter. \n\nThe musicians went into the studio with Matt Wallace, a producer known for his work with Maroon 5, O.A.R. and Faith No More, in early 2012. Matt helped focus the group’s vision and expand their musical knowledge base, an experience the band members compare to being in their own version of college. The album was recorded in various studios over the course of a year, honing in on Pepper’s re-defined self-identity and how that focus was reflected in the songs. \n\n“We learned so much,” Yesod says. “Matt help us really focus on the art of songwriting. He sat in the room with the three of us with a fine-tooth comb and went over every word, every melody, every sound. He showed us that it’s important what you do play as well as what you don’t play, creating both spaces in the songs. We learned how powerful simplicity can be. Plus, we had such a good time recording this album and I think that shows.”\n\nThe resulting album, self-titled to accentuate where the band feels they are presently, broadens Pepper’s style, veering into new sonic territory while still retaining all the fun elements that make the band so beloved by their fans. The ever-present sense of life surges through the tracks, bolstering the sense of optimism throughout. The party anthems, the beach hang melodies, and the boisterous rhythms are all there, each song carefully crafted to best express these sunny moments by the ocean. \n\n“This album is basically 12 snapshots of where we are,” vocalist/bassist Bret Bollinger says. “There are songs that will remind you of your favorite Pepper songs, but by the end you’ll hear some unexpected things. You’ll realize that the songwriting is so much more refined. And there’s laughter in the background of the songs. That’s how good the vibe is on the record.” \n\nPepper has toured extensively with groups like 311, Slightly Stoopid, Flogging Molly and Sublime With Rome, and spent several summers on Warped Tour – and this live sensibility shows. You can almost feel the sand in your toes and the sun on your back as the album progresses, the musician’s amiable personalities palpable beneath the island rhythms and mellow tones. The band’s music – both live and on their releases – is really about enjoying life and being grateful for each experience, a sensibility that’s very familiar to the three musicians currently in their career. From their 1999 debut Give’n It to their 2006 standout album No Shame, which was recorded with 311’s Nick Hexum, No Doubt’s Tony Kanal and Butthole Surfers’ Paul Leary, Pepper has embodied not only a style of music but a lifestyle, one that’s most easily found on beaches across the world, but also one that’s relatable to anyone anywhere. \n\nReleased via their own label LAW Records, their universal appeal has led their music being placed in various movies and TV shows, including Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Good Luck Chuck, as well as several video game soundtracks. The band’s story to date has been a prolific one. But as Pepper turns the page into a fresh chapter with this new album, it’s clear that the band’s passion for music and life will continue on for years to come. \n\n“We’re so blessed to be in this position,” Kaleo says. “We want to do the best we can with it. We had humble beginnings in our small town in Hawaii and we’re still that same humble band. We don’t take any of this lightly. Every day I wake up and think about how I have the best job in the world. The level of gratitude and happiness I have that we’re able to do this is incredible and I hope people can hear that when they listen to our new songs.”  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pepper\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Opeth is a progressive metal band from Sweden that is influenced by many diverse musical styles ranging from 1970s progressive rock and death metal, Their recent releases have deviated from their traditional death metal-influenced style, with more emphasis on progressive elements. Frontman and vocalist Mikael Åkerfeldt is also noted for utilizing both clean singing and death growls, often in the same song. Due to their unique blend of melodic and progressive elements, Opeth are often classified separately from more typical death metal acts. The name Opeth was taken from Wilbur Smith's novel Sunbird and derived from Opet, a city of the moon named in the novel.\n\nHistory\nOpeth was formed in Stockholm, Södermanland, Sweden in 1990 by David Isberg. Isberg invited Mikael Åkerfeldt to join the band at a practice session as a bass player, but failed to inform the current bass player or any of the other members of the band. Because of this, all band members except for Isberg quit, and Åkerfeldt soon joined Opeth after his band, Eruption, faltered. With Åkerfeldt on guitar and David Isberg on vocals, Opeth still lacked members and needing more, they were soon joined by long-time friend of Åkerfeldt and former Eruption drummer Anders Nordin and Nick Döring on bass. Andreas Dimeo was recruited as a second guitarist. Rehearsing in an elementary school with old equipment they had found, this lineup lasted less than a year and only played one show. In 1991 they spent the summer rehearsing on the island of Hamnholmen outside Stockholm with their old school friend and bass player Max Jaderberg, who suggested a more prominent bass sound.\n\nAfter their first performance, Andreas Dimeo and Nick Döring quit the band. For the second performance, guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan DeFarfalla joined the group. After the show, DeFarfalla left to spend time with his girlfriend and did not return until 1994. Pettersson stuck with the band for another show before leaving in late 1991. DaFarfall was replaced by Peter Lindgren, playing the bass. However, once Pettersson left, Lindgren returned to the guitar, his original instrument. Isberg left the band in early 1992 due to creative differences and boredom. Since Mikael had previous experience as a vocalist from fronting Eruption, he became the new vocalist and immediately began writing material with Peter Lindgren. They rehearsed as a 3-piece for more than a year but eventually found a new bass player, Stefan Guteklint, who was dismissed by the band before they signed their record contract with Candlelight Records.\n\nImpressed by their originality, Candlelight Records released their debut full-length Orchid in 1995. It featured a rhythm section of bassist Johan DeFarfalla and drummer Anders Nordin. Dan Swanö, of Edge of Sanity fame, produced the band's ambitious second album Morningrise in 1996. After this Opeth embarked on a brief tour with Morbid Angel. Century Media took notice and not only licensed Opeth's first two albums for the United States, but also planned on releasing their next album on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe next album would introduce a change in style as well as line-up. With the recruitment of bassist Martin Mendez to replace DeFarfalla and drummer Martin Lopez (ex-Amon Amarth) replacing Nordin, Opeth's third album, entitled My Arms, Your Hearse, was released in 1998 to glowing reviews, establishing the band as a leading force in progressive metal with death roots. The album is conceptually based on a character who dies and returns to Earth as a ghost.  \n\n1999's Still Life displayed even more of the band's progressive rock influences, and the following year the band played its first U.S. concert at the Milwaukee Metalfest. This was the first album on which Martin Mendez contributed. Like My Arms, Your Hearse before it, Still Life is also a concept album, revolving around a man who is banished from his village for dissenting religious beliefs. The album then then regals the tale of his courtship of the character Melinda. \n\nTheir next album, Blackwater Park, was released in early 2001 and was titled after an obscure psychedelic progressive rock band from the '70s. Blackwater Park is considered to be Opeth's magnum opus and the defining document of their career. The album created a huge buzz among progressive metal fans, who had begun to lump the band in with other experimental metal bands like Tiamat. It was the first of three albums that Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree fame would produce. Wilson also contributed backing vocals and guitar. \n\nInstead of waiting until the buzz died down, the band released Deliverance (also known as D1) in the fall of 2002, which was intended to be a double album, Damnation (or D2) comprising the other half. Deliverance presented the typical death metal aspect of Opeth while Damnation presented a new side of Opeth: the album that was almost completely devoid of any heavy metal trappings and focused instead on acoustic instruments and traditional songwriting. Steven Wilson again contributed by co-authoring one song, Death Whispered a Lullaby, and by providing backing vocals and playing mellotron, piano, electric piano, keyboards, and guitar.\n\nOpeth then released a DVD, \"Lamentations\", filmed in England during the Damnation Tour, in fall of '03. It featured the Damnation album in its entirety along with some highlights from the previous two albums. Now signed to the major label Roadrunner Records, Opeth's next album Ghost Reveries arrived in 2005 and proved to be a return to form for the band. Shortly before the recordings of this album, Per Wiberg (Spiritual Beggars) officially joined the band to play keyboards, as he did on the tour that supported Damnation. He can also be seen on the \"Lamentations\" DVD. More lineup changes followed in May of 2006, when long time drummer Martin Lopez left the band due to complications from a rare disease he has. After a short delay, he was replaced by Martin Axe Axenrot, former drummer of Bloodbath.\n\nOn May 17th, 2007, an open letter from Peter Lindgren was posted on the official Opeth website where he wrote that he had decided to leave the band. He said that he had lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown to become a world-wide industry. It was especially the massive amount of touring, and being away from home for long periods of time that caused this decision. \"I have come to a point where I realise I won't be able to give the band 100%, and from both sides this will not be good enough for what Opeth stands for.\" On the same day Fredrik Åkesson (ex-Arch Enemy, Krux) was announced as the new guitar-player and full-time member of Opeth.\n\nIn Fall 2007, Opeth released their first live album, The Roundhouse Tapes, recorded in the famous Roundhouse concert hall in Great Britain.\n\nThe progressive rock/metal band Dream Theater announced in November of 2007 that Opeth would be joining them on the Progressive Nation 2008 tour. Joining these two bands were Between the Buried and Me and 3.\n\nOpeth's ninth studio album, entitled Watershed was released on June 3, 2008. It was well received by most fans and critics. The first single from the album, Porcelain Heart, was released on April 19th, 2008.

    "headlinerBio": "3OH!3 is an American electronica group from Boulder, Colorado, named after the 303 area code which covers Boulder, Aurora and the Denver metropolitan area. Formed in 2004, Sean Foreman and Nathaniel Motte were inspired by the hip-hop electronic scene and Foreman invited Motte to mix some beats and hang out with him. They released their self-titled debut album in 2007, but it was not a commercial success. Their second album, Want, was released in July 2008 and features the highly successful singles Don't Trust Me and Starstrukk (the deluxe edition has a re-recording which features Katy Perry).\n\nAfter playing the first show in Florida of Warped Tour 2007, 3OH!3 signed on for all venues of Warped Tour 2008 with the exception of Philadelphia on July 25. Their song \"Punkbitch\" is featured on the Warped Tour 2008 Tour Compilation.

    "headlinerBio": "Tracy Lawrence (born 27 January 1968) is an American country musician.\n\nTracy Lawrence was born in Atlanta, Texas, and raised in Foreman, Ark.,  Lawrence played in his first band at the age of 16. He attended Southern Arkansas University in Magnolia, where he was a member of Sigma Pi Fraternity. In 1990 Lawrence left Arkansas and went to Nashville.\n\nLawrence took jobs as an ironworker and in phone sales while he tried to break into the Nashville music scene. He began participating in talent shows and earned enough money to live on. In 1991 he had a gig at the Bluebird Cafe and met Wayne Edwards who became his manager.\n\nWith Edwards assistance Lawrence signed with Atlantic Records and released his first album \"Sticks and Stones.\"  On 31 May 1991 Lawrence walked his former girlfriend to the door of her hotel room and was confronted by three armed men. The men robbed them and attempted to force Lawrence and his friend into her motel room. Lawrence resisted and was shot four times, allowing his friend to escape. Two of the wounds were major and necessitated surgery. One of the bullets remains imbedded in Lawrence's pelvis.\n\nLawrence's album shot up the charts to number one on the back of publicity from the shooting and spawned several Top 10 singles. Lawrence's second album Alibis went Platinum and generated three straight Number One singles.\n\nLawrence was Billboard's Top New Male Vocalist in 1992 and received the Academy of Country Music's Best New Artist and Top New Male Vocalist in 1993.\n\nIn 1994 Lawrence released his third album, I See It Now was also a Platinum album. Lawrence released a Live album in 1995 and another studio album entitled Time Marches On in 1996. In 1997 Lawrence released another album entitled Coast is Clear which he co-produced. All told, Lawrence generated 7 Number One singles by this time and every one of his albums at this point in his career had gone Platinum.\n\nIn 2005, he released the album \"Then & Now: The Hits Collection\" that had him singing new vocals on the majority of his hit songs, as well as two new songs, \"Used to the Pain\" and \"If I Don't Make it Back.\" both of which charted on the Billboard Country Charts. The new recordings sounded very similar to the previous ones, although on some tracks, such as \"I See It Now\" and \"If The World Had a Front Porch\" Lawrence's maturity may have improved the vocals, giving them a little more depth. The main reason for re-recording the songs instead of just making a run of the mill greatest hits collection was that Lawrence had switched record labels and Universal Music Group, who he currently records for, does not hold the rights to the old recordings. The new album was very well received and is leaving fans wanting even more out of the unique country star.\n\nIn 2006, Lawrence launched Rocky Comfort Records (RCR), a partnership with his manager Laney Lawrence. The label will operate as a joint venture with CO5 Nashville (a division of CO5 Music). His new single \"Find Out Who Your Friends Are,” will be released to radio August 21, 2006 with his first studio album on the RCR/CO5 Nashville imprint scheduled for release in early 2007.\n\nLawrence is known to have a wide range with sounds ranging from neotraditional country to songs with a definite southern rock feel.\n\nLawrence has visited US troops involved in peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and annually participates in a golf tournament to raise funds for cystic fibrosis research. Lawrence has also purchased equipment for his hometown high school in Arkansas.\n\nLawrence has been inducted into the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tracy+Lawrence\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The follow-up single, titled ‘Dusty’, surpassed all expectations, racking up diverse DJ support from the UK’s Jody Wisternoff and Kidnap Kid to California’s Viceroy and Geisha Twins. From there, a 3-track EP, reworks of Fleetwood Mac and Brandy, and an official remix for Austin-based band Snowden have all solidified Lane 8’s position as a household name in the growing California house scene.

    "headlinerBio": "Dwight David Yoakam (born October 23, 1956) is an American singer-songwriter, actor and film director, most famous for his pioneering country music. Popular since the early 1980s, he has recorded more than 21 albums and compilations, charted more than 30 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, and sold more than 25 million records. Yoakam has recorded 5 Billboard #1 Albums, 12 Gold Albums, and 9 Platinum Albums, including the Triple Platinum This Time. In addition to his many achievements in the performing arts, Yoakam is also the most frequent musical guest in the history of The Tonight Show.\n\nYoakam was born in Pikeville, Kentucky, the son of Ruth Ann, a key-punch operator, and David Yoakam, a gas-station owner. He was raised in Columbus, Ohio. He graduated from Columbus's Northland High School in 1974. During his high school years, he excelled in both music and drama, regularly securing the lead role in school plays, such as \"Charlie\" in a stage version of Flowers for Algernon, honing his skills under the guidance of teacher-mentors Jerry McAfee (music) and Charles Lewis (drama). Outside of school, Yoakam sang and played guitar with local garage bands, and entertained his friends and classmates with his impersonations, such as Richard Nixon, who, at the time, was heavily embroiled in the Watergate controversy.\n\nYoakam briefly attended Ohio State University, but dropped out and moved to Nashville in 1977 with the intent of becoming a recording artist. Later on, Ohio Valley University in Parkersburg, West Virginia awarded and presented Dwight with an honorary doctorate degree on May 7, 2005.\n\nWhen he began his career, Nashville was oriented toward pop \"urban cowboy\" music, and Yoakam's brand of hip honky tonk music was not considered marketable.\n\nNot making much headway in Nashville, Yoakam moved to Los Angeles and worked towards bringing his particular brand of new Honky Tonk or \"Hillbilly\" music (as he called it) forward into the 1980s. Writing all his own songs, and continuing to perform mostly outside traditional country music channels, Yoakam did many shows in rock and punk rock clubs around Los Angeles, playing with roots rock or punk rock acts like The Blasters (Yoakam scored a small video hit with his version of their song \"Long White Cadillac\"), Los Lobos, and X. This helped him diversify his audience beyond the typical country music fans, and his authentic, groundbreaking music is often credited with rock audiences accepting country music.\n\nYoakam's recording debut was the self-financed EP Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc. on independent label Oak Records produced by lead-guitarist Pete Anderson; this was later re-released by Reprise records, with several additional tracks, as his major-label debut LP, 1986's Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.. It launched his career. \"Honky Tonk Man\", a remake of the Johnny Horton song, and \"Guitars, Cadillacs\" were hit singles. His stylish video \"Honky Tonk Man\" was the first country music video ever played on MTV. The follow-up LP, Hillbilly Deluxe, was just as successful. His third LP, Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room, included his first No. 1, a duet with his musical idol, Buck Owens, on \"Streets of Bakersfield\". 1990's If There Was a Way was another best-seller.\n\nYoakam's song \"Readin', Rightin', Route 23\" pays tribute to his childhood move from Kentucky, and is named after a local expression describing the route that rural Kentuckians took to find a job outside of the coal mines. (U.S. Route 23 runs north from Kentucky through Columbus and Toledo, Ohio and through the automotive centers of Michigan.) Rather than the standard line that their elementary schools taught \"the three Rs\" of \"Readin', 'Ritin', and 'Rithmetic\", Kentuckians used to say that the three Rs they learned were \"Readin', 'Ritin, and Route 23 North\".\n\nJohnny Cash once cited Yoakam as his favorite country singer. Chris Isaak called him as good a songwriter that ever put a pen to paper. Time Magazine dubbed Yoakam \"A Renaissance Man\" and Vanity Fair declared that \"Yoakam strides the divide between rock's lust and country's lament.\" Along with his bluegrass and honky-tonk roots, Yoakam has written or covered many Elvis Presley-style rockabilly songs, including his covers of Queen's \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" in 1999 and Presley's \"Suspicious Minds\" in 1992. He recorded a cover of The Clash's \"Train in Vain\" in 1997, a cover of the Grateful Dead song \"Truckin'\", as well as Cheap Trick's \"I Want You to Want Me\". Yoakam has never been associated only with Country music; on many early tours, he played with Hardcore Punk bands like Hüsker Dü, and played many shows around Los Angeles with Roots/Punk/Rock & Roll acts. His middle-period-to-later records saw him branching out to different styles, covering Rock & Roll, Punk, 1960's, Blues-based \"Boogie\" like ZZ Top, and writing more adventurous songs like \"A Thousand Miles From Nowhere\". In 2003, he provided background vocals on Warren Zevon's last album The Wind.\n\nIn the 21st century, Yoakam released dwightyoakamacoustic.net, an album featuring solo acoustic versions of many of his hits; left his major label and started his own label.\n\n2005 saw the release of Yoakam's well-reviewed album Blame the Vain, on New West Records. Yoakam also released an album dedicated to Buck Owens, Dwight Sings Buck, on October 23, 2007. His duet with Michelle Branch, a song titled \"Long Goodbye\", was released as a free download on Branch's official website in early 2011.\n\nIn July 2011, Yoakam re-signed with Warner Bros. Nashville and announced plans to release a new album. 3 Pears was released on September 18, 2012 with twelve new tracks. The album, produced by Yoakam, includes collaborations with Kid Rock, Beck, and Ashley Monroe. 3 Pears was released to resounding critical acclaim and earned Yoakam the highest-charting debut of his career on the Billboard 200 and Billboard Country Albums charts. 3 Pears reached #1 on the Americana Radio chart on October 29, 2012 and went on to break the 2012 record for most weeks at #1 on Americana Radio.[4] By the end of 2012, the album was named on annual best of lists by NPR, Rolling Stone, American Songwriter, AOL's The Boot, Entertainment Weekly, The Village Voice, and Rhapsody, and has been included in more critic's \"best of 2012\" lists than any other artist in the country genre.\n\nYoakam won the Grammy Award for \"Best Male Country Vocal Performance\" in 1993 for the song \"Ain't That Lonely Yet\". He was also named \"Artist of the Year\" by CMT Europe in 1993 and given the International Touring Artist Award by CMA in 2007.\n\nIn 2011, Yoakam received the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award for his trailblazing achievements in the country music genre. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dwight+Yoakam\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Keane is an English rock band, first established in Battle, East Sussex, United Kingdom in 1995, taking their current name in 1997. The group is comprised of composer, bassist, and pianist Tim Rice-Oxley, lead vocalist Tom Chaplin and drummer Richard Hughes. Their original line-up included founder and guitarist Dominic Scott, who left in 2001. For their 2008 album \"Perfect Symmetry\" and the following tour, Jesse Quin joined the band on stage to play bass. He also played a large role in recording the album itself, and he subsequently joined the band fully in 2011. \n\nKeane are known for using a piano as their lead instrument instead of guitars, significantly differentiating them from most rock bands. The inclusion of a distorted piano effect since 2006 and various synthesizers are now a common feature in their music that nowadays combines the pure piano rock sound used during their first album and the alternative rock sound which developed during 2005. Acoustic and power ballads are also a highlight in the group's music and have evolved into many fan favourite songs such as \"On a Day Like Today\" and \"We Might As Well Be Strangers\".\n\nKeane's first two studio albums, Hopes and Fears and Under the Iron Sea, achieved great success in the United Kingdom upon release and very high sales worldwide: their multi-award-winning debut was the best-selling British album of 2004 and their follow-up sold 222,297 copies during its first week on sale in June 2006. \n\nTheir third album, Perfect Symmetry was released on 13th October 2008. First single 'Spiralling' was available for free download, and half a million copies were downloaded worldwide. The album has clear 80s influences, and is compared in Q magazine to both David Bowie's 'Scary Monsters' and The Dandy Warhols' 'Welcome To The Monkey House'. The band have cited Talking Heads as another key influence. This was their first album to include guitar, successfully breaking away from their original set-up.\n\nTheir fourth album, Strangeland was released from 4 May 2012 through Island Records. First single 'Silenced By The Night' peaked at #14, despite the fact it was originally only to be released as a commercial single in the United States, but was released worldwide apart from the United Kingdom on March 13, 2012. The single was finally dropped in Keane's home country April 15, 2012. The album also spawned the Top 60 single \"Disconnected\" as well as the Top 30 track \"Sovereign Light Café\", which reached peak popularity after being remixed by DJ Afrojack.\n\nKeane announced their upcoming new album, then revealed to be titled \"Cause and Effect\", in March of 2019. The first single \"The Way I Feel\" was released in June of that same year, garnering over 2 million views.\n\nKeane's fifth album will be released September 20th, 2019. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Keane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Third Eye Blind is a rock band formed in the mid 1990s in San Francisco, California. The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue — at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Abe Millett (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Kryz Reid (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, was released August 2009.  Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped. A number of previously unreleased recordings were made available, including \"Persephone,\" \"Carnival Barker\" (an instrumental), and numerous instrumental sessions declined by Jenkins for inclusion on the fourth album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Third+Eye+Blind\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Whiskey Myers is an American southern rock group from Tyler, Texas composed of Cody Cannon, Cody Tate, John Jeffers, Jeff Hogg and Gary Brown. In 2008, they signed with Smith Entertainment and released their debut album, Road of Life. Their second album, Firewater, was released by Wiggy Thump in 2011 and debuted in the Top 30 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.\n\nIn a modest rent house in the small East Texas town of Elkhart, Texas, Cody Cannon and Cody Tate began to write music, only dreaming of the success that is sure to follow. They began to incorporate the talent and imagination of friend and guitarist John Jeffers. At that time, they called themselves Lucky Southern, though they had only three members. As time passed, with their inspiration mounting, they moved to Tyler, Texas. There they met up with Jeff Hogg, a mutual friend and drummer from Palestine, Texas, and Gary Brown, a bass guitarist who had grown up in Neches, Texas. They came together and came to be known as Whiskey Myers.\n\nSoon, the group was playing private parties on flatbed trailers in small towns around East Texas. The sound they emitted was something more unique than anyone had expected. From their first show in Montalba, Texas, a young Whiskey Myers was hooked on performing, and the crowds were hooked on them. In the spring of 2007, they were given the opportunity to open for Roger Creager at Gator’s Bar and Grill in Gun Barrel City, Texas. The club owner was so impressed by their performance and the crowd that had come to the stage that he asked them to come back the next weekend to open for The Eli Young Band. From then on, popularity for the band began to swell. They were heard on live stages all over East Texas, in interviews on local radio stations, and seen on television giving live interviews. Suddenly it seemed that the whole region knew who Whiskey Myers was, and everyone was becoming familiar with their high energy twin guitars, soulful vocals, and unstoppable rhythm.\n\nWhiskey Myers’ musical style was forged from several different genres of music from several different eras. The most obvious of these are the blues rock jam bands such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, and Led Zeppelin. Whiskey Myers takes the blues rock genre and mixes it with modern day Texas Country such as Reckless Kelly, Randy Rogers, and Cross Canadian Ragweed to derive a new sound that is sure to take concert listeners on an atmospheric roller coaster. With a sound like no other and a stage presence that captivates anyone close enough to notice, a live concert performed by this young band is something that must be seen to be believed.\n\nThe Tyler area has been instrumental in the development of Whiskey Myers from a group of musicians to a band.

    "headlinerBio": "Bad Religion is a punk rock band from Los Angeles, California, known for the social commentary in their lyrics. The band was formed in 1979 by high school students Greg Graffin (vocals), Jay Bentley (bass guitar), Jay Ziskrout (drums), and Brett Gurewitz (guitar). In 1981, they released their eponymous debut EP on their own newly-formed label, Epitaph, managed and owned by Gurewitz. 1982 saw the release of their first full-length album, How Could Hell be Any Worse?, which gained them a sizable following. During the recording, Ziskrout left the band and was replaced by Peter Finestone.\n\nGreg Graffin, the band's frontman, holds a Master's degree in geology from UCLA and a Ph.D. in zoology from Cornell University. His dissertation for Cornell was a comprehensive study of how modern scientists, especially those who believe in strict Darwinism, view theism and religion, and how their own religious beliefs, if any, affect their study and work. He has since published it for fans of the band.\n\nIn 1983, Bad Religion released into the unknown, a keyboard-driven psychedelic rock album that was enormously unpopular among the band's core fan base. It is now out of print, and generally disowned by the band. However, in past years it has become a collectors item, and has gained some acceptance from fans. It now can be seen going for more than $100 on eBay, and is often pirated.\n\nIn 1984, Greg Hetson (Circle Jerks) replaced Gurewitz. Bad Religion returned to a somewhat mellower, rock and roll version of their original sound with the back to the known, but they disbanded soon after.\n\nThe band reformed in 1987 and released suffer in 1988, cementing their comeback in the punk community. Not only is this album considered one of their best by most fans, but it is often credited with \"saving\" the Southern Californian punk rock scene by fans and Bad Religion's contemporaries alike.\n\nno control (1989) and against the grain (1990) further increased the band's popularity, followed by generator (1992). Before the recording sessions for the latter album commenced, drummer Pete Finestone left the band in to focus on his other band, The Fishermen. Bobby Schayer joined the band as his replacement. recipe for hate (1993) followed shortly thereafter.\n\nWith alternative rock breaking into the mainstream, Bad Religion left Epitaph for major label Atlantic and quickly re-released Recipe for Hate on the major label. 1994's stranger than fiction followed, but shortly after its release Brett Gurewitz left the band again. Officially, he cited the increasing amount of time he was spending at Epitaph's offices as the Offspring (then a part of the Epitaph roster) became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s. But it was well-known that the departure was not on good terms, as he later accused the band of selling out for leaving Epitaph in favor of a major label. Gurewitz recorded a song with his new band The Daredevils entitled \"Hate You,\" reportedly directed towards Jay Bentley. Gurewitz, moreover, was struggling more seriously with heroin and other addictions that had plagued him for years.\n\nGurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker, former member of bands such as Minor Threat and Dag Nasty. Previously, Graffin and Gurewitz had split songwriting duties, but Gurewitz's departure left Graffin as the band's lone songwriter.\n\nWhat followed were a series of moderately successful albums, the gray race (1996), no substance (1998), and the new america (2000). As their popularity waned, Bad Religion left Atlantic in 2001 and returned to Epitaph. Bobby Schayer left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by Brooks Wackerman (Suicidal Tendencies) and Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band in time to record the process of belief (2002). the empire strikes first was in June 2004. Both albums are widely regarded as a return to form for the band. \n\nIn 2004, the band released digitally-remastered versions of five of their early albums (How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, Suffer, No Control, Against the Grain, and Generator). The How Could Hell Be Any Worse? re-issue also contained all of their first EP, the Public Service EP (alternative versions of Bad Religion, Slaves and Drastic Actions from the self titled EP) and Back To The Known.\n\nBad Religion's fourtheenth full-length studio album, titled new maps of hell, was released on July 10, 2007. It debuted at #35 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 21,000 copies in its first week. It was originally intended to be released in 2006, but was pushed back largely due to the release of Graffin's second solo album, cold as the clay and his work at UCLA.\n\nIn 2010, Bad Religion released  30 Years Live for the band's 30th anniversary. The album was available for free to subscribers of the Bad Religion mailing list. Later the same year, Bad Religion released their fifteenth studio album, The Dissent of Man. The album took nearly two years to write and record, mainly due to the band's heavy touring schedule. \n\nBrett Gurewitz, who still heads Epitaph Records, still records with the band and plays local shows, but doesn't tour with them.  Greg Hetson can still be found at the occasional Circle Jerks show and helped open a bar in LA.  Wackerman is working on a side project called The Kidneys.  Graffin spends 10 weeks a year teaching two classes (Life Sciences 1 and Earth and Space Sciences 116) at UCLA.  Jay Bentley keeps the Bad Religion MySpace page updated.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Religion\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Beats Antique creates a definitive union between the old and new. Tribal Derivations is centered in Middle Eastern bellydance, down tempo hip hop, old school jazz, classical Indian and North African Gnawa music. Zoe Jakes, an innovative tribal and tribal fusion belly dancer, has co-produced, with Sidecar Tommy and David Satori, a refreshing musical take on an antique aesthetic.\n\nFrom http://www.beatsantique.com\n\nGrowing like wildfire under the canopy of live electonica and world roots music comes a masterful merge of modern technology, live instrumentation and seductive performance, built of brass bands and glitch, string quartets and dubstep: the musical trio Beats Antique.\n\nSince the group’s inception from the eclectic underground of San Francisco’s performance art scene, Beats Antique has been notorious for making it nearly impossible to sit still. They meld their mediums as attentively as they fuse the cultures that inspire their sound. All self produced and composed, the trio creates a unique collage: an animalistic, raw musical event that blurs the lines between the provocative, the spiritual, and the artistic, while still maintaining an allegiance to the muses of class and beauty.\n\nThe journey that led to Beats Antique today was a winding and twisted path from the west coast to the ancient trade routes of the silk  road. In this modern incarnation, the musical alliance of producers David Satori and Tommy Cappel is inspired and emphasized by their collaborative partnership with world-renowned belly dance performer and music producer Zoe Jakes.\n\nDavid Satori and Tommy Cappel both trained classically before venturing to locations such as Bali, West Africa, Serbia and beyond. With extensive backgrounds in multicultural music production, and the passports to prove it, Satori and Cappel command the spectrum of live and digital instrumentation, born from Hip Hop and old school jazz.\n\nZoe Jakes adds a third dimension as the multi –cultural and –disciplinary dance counterpart to Beats Antique’s sound. Jakes has worked with 2  major dance troupes, Miles Copeland’s Bellydance Superstars and Rachel Brice’s Indigo Belly Dance Company, a student of ballet and contemporary techniques. Jake’s additional history with Cappel in the Extra Action Marching Band and the Yard Dogs Road Show grants some insight into the caliber of performance that is Beats Antique’s standard.\n\nAll of this sets the scene for Beats Antique’s overtly ambitious stage show, a sensory overload conquest of the festival circuit’s most riotous events, such as Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits festival, and Outside Lands, as well as a catalog of proper tours that include Bassnectar and a recent run with Les Claypool of PRIMUS in early 2010. According to Satori, the trio is excited by their ability to create a huge sound from their relatively small setup. “It gives us this whole new world of musical opportunities that we’re just starting to scratch the surface of.”\n\nIn a prolific 3 years since Beats Antique emerged, the group has released 2 albums and a pair of EPs, with a third album, Blind Threshold, on the way. Notable features of the new release include vaporous violins and Danny Elfman-esque dementia; glitchy, laser-guided harmonica provided by Blues Traveler frontman John Popper; and 2 very different vocal tracks that range between restless pop hooks and vibrant Eastern European dance loops. All wrapped into an intricate collection of heavy beats and sub bass.\n\nBeats Antique is best imagined as an innovative creature built from the cumulative heritage of the world’s music chasing its tail. However vivid that image, when a marching band groove crashes into bluesy folk chords only to be accompanied by electronic beats and Middle Eastern melodies, you’ll still be surprised. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beats+Antique\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Dispatch is an American indie-roots band founded in 1996 in Middlebury, Vermont.\n\nThe band originated in the early 1990s as One Fell Swoop, but changed their name to Dispatch in 1996. Chad Urmston, Braddigan, and Pete (Francis) Heimbold, who were all attending Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont comprised the band's lineup throughout their entire career. Their music has drawn on several influences, such as acoustic folk-rock, reggae, and funk.\n\nDispatch gained much recognition outside of New England, without any help from a label, and stuck together long enough to release seven albums, three of which were live performances. During concerts, the band had been known to improvise upon their album releases, often resulting in a song ending in twice the length of the original. The group was also fond of switching instruments and vocal duties when playing live.\n\nUpon the announcement of its break-up in 2002, the band scheduled one final concert. The free show was performed at the Hatch Shell in Boston on July 31, 2004. \"The Last Dispatch,\" as it was referred, is said to be the largest concert in independent music history; roughly 110,000 fans from over 20 different countries attended the show. Parts of the performance were released as a CD/DVD two-disc set later that year, entitled All Points Bulletin, along with an earlier show in Somerville, Massachusetts.\n\nAll three of the band's members are currently still in the music industry. Urmston is now the frontman of State Radio, while Corrigan (now credited as Braddigan, a nickname by which he was known since his time with Dispatch) and Heimbold (now credited as Pete Francis, his middle name) are succesfully pursuing solo efforts.\n\nAfter the song Elias, written by Urmston after his experience living and teaching in Zimbabwe, the \"Elias Fund\" was formed to send children from the ravaged country to college.\n\nDispatch came out with a movie entitled \"Last Dispatch\" in July 2005, which documents their final 12 days together as a band and tells the story of how they became \"the band that redefined independent music history\". The film was released and previewed in Boston. Chad, Brad, and Pete attended the showing and celebrated throughout the weekend with their fans.\n\nOn December 22, 2005, Corrigan helped to organize a benefit concert, known as the Relief Project, at Irving Plaza in New York, New York. Along with several other performers, Corrigan invited Heimbold and State Radio to play. The three reunited very briefly, playing the song Here We Go as an encore. Corrigan stated there that he plans further Relief Project concerts featuring all three and perhaps sometime in 2007, a major Dispatch reunion concert.  \nEntitled \"Dispatch: Zimbabwe\", Dispatch arranged for one show in Madison Square Garden, with all the money sent towards relief efforts in Zimbabwe.  Originally billed as a one show deal on July 14, Dispatch was surprised how quickly this first show sold out and set two more shows for the 13 and 15. After all three shows sold out, Dispatch announced another smaller show on July 11th at Webster Hall in  New York, where they made their comeback debut to great success.  \n\nDispatch had a second set of reunion concerts beginning at Red Rocks amphitheater in Denver, Colorado on June 3, 4, and 5th,  2011. These performances launched a reunion tour around the US and the release of their Dispatch EP on May 17th.\n\nIn 2017, the band released the song, \"Only The Wild Ones\" from their album, America, Location 12. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dispatch\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Tiësto is a name that no longer needs an introduction. He is synonymous with the best of electronic music, and continues to inspire a generation of up-and-coming young artists.\n\nIn addition to two Grammy nominations and a Grammy win in 2015, Tiësto has been named the #1 DJ by Rolling Stone, voted “The Greatest DJ of All Time” by Mixmag, ranked the #1 DJ in the world three times by DJ Mag, and was recently awarded the Edison Pop Oeuvre Lifetime Achievement Award (an honor he shares with David Bowie, Quincy Jones and U2 among others).\n\nAfter conquering the house and trance worlds, the superstar producer led the charge in helping electronic music crossover into the mainstream with his last album, A Town Called Paradise in 2014. His single “Red Lights” is now certified gold in the US, Sweden and Canada, while “Wasted” with Matthew Koma recently went platinum in the US and is his highest-charting release to date. Clearly a taste of what was to come, Tiësto has recently dropped new tunes with the The Chainsmokers, Martin Garrix, and pop sensation Natalie La Rose.\n\nCollaborations are nothing new for Tiësto, who believes in passing along his success by working with well-known names like Martin Garrix and Oliver Heldens, to name a few. For years now, he has helped up-and-coming acts in the electronic world find their way with his record label, Musical Freedom. Aside from his label, he also took part in 7Up’s DJing competition “Your Shot,” a competition for aspiring DJ’s to learn the craft and perform alongside Tiësto in Las Vegas.\n\nAt this point in his career, Tiësto has toured the world countless times, performing for millions at Ultra, Coachella, Tomorrowland, TomorrowWorld and Electric Daisy Carnival, in addition to the innumerable clubs that he headlines. He’s one of the few DJs in the world to hold a residency in Las Vegas, where he plays at Hakkasan and Wet Republic.\n\nIn spite of his hectic tour schedule, residency, and focus on creating new music, Tiësto hasn’t forgotten his roots. As a champion of the DJ mix for decades, his Club Life compilations have become a staple in the dance world as has his Sirius XM channel of the same name. In addition, his weekly radio show is broadcast on 350 stations in 77 countries and has over 35 million listeners.\n\nTiësto also remains an expert remixer to the biggest names in music, reworking smash hits for the likes of Beyoncé, Coldplay, Kanye West, Sam Smith, Ellie Goulding, David Guetta, Major Lazer, Calvin Harris, and many more. In 2015, he won his first Grammy Award for his massively popular remix of John Legend’s “All Of Me.”\n\nTiësto has successfully transitioned his influence and savvy to industries beyond music, acting as an advisor to tech startups like Splice, Dubset and Doppler. Most recently, Tiësto released his newly re-designed mobile app, where fans can consume all things Tiësto. Through current collaborations with T-Mobile and Budweiser and soon-to-be-revealed efforts in the fashion space, the DJ is bringing dance music culture to more people than ever before.\n\nThroughout the past two decades, Tiësto has remained not only one of the world’s most prolific and enduring artists, but one of music’s top innovators. In spite of his accomplishments, Tiësto does not see his work as being done. “DJing is my life,” the man isn’t afraid to admit. But more than that, “It’s a lifestyle.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ti%C3%ABsto\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Gary Allan Herzberg (born December 5, 1967) is an American country music artist, known professionally as Gary Allan. \n\nAllan was born and raised in La Mirada, California, to Harley and Mary Herzberg. To ensure that the family would focus on music, Allan's mother insisted that the family's guitars would always remain visible in the home. At age thirteen, Allan began playing in honky tonks with his father. Two years later, he was offered his first recording contract, from A&M Records, but rejected the deal. His parents wanted him to finish his education and his father felt that Allan had yet to develop his own distinctive style. Despite his commitment to finishing school, Allan reflects that he was rarely alert in class. \"I played the bars at night, I was half asleep when I got to school. I thought sleep was what you did when you got to school.\" After finishing school, he continued to play in the bars with his band, the Honky Tonk Wranglers. Many of the venues they played were packed, and promoters often tried to move them to larger clubs. The moves would have required him to stop playing some of the older country music, such as covers of George Jones songs, so Allan refused.\n\nAllan was introduced to songwriter/producer Byron Hill on August 28, 1993 by a mutual friend and talent-scout Jim Seal at a bar called the Lion D'or in Downey, California, where Allan was already regularly performing. Seal and Hill had asked Allan if they could showcase an unsigned act that they were developing there. Hill had arranged to bring the head of A&R from a major label to the show to see this other act perform. Allan kindly let them use his stage for the event, giving the new act the opening performance slot that night. Hill promised Gary that they would make sure the A&R person remained there to see his portion of the show. Everyone was knocked out with Allan's performance, and very impressed with his voice. From that point on, Hill began sending Allan songs. Without any serious funding at the time, Hill arranged for Allan to go into Seal's small studio in California to try his vocals on some of existing demo tracks that Hill had sent to Allan from Nashville, Tennessee. Meanwhile, Hill became head of A&R at BNA Entertainment on October 29 of that same year and immediately wanted to sign Allan to BNA, but the then current roster conditions and other circumstances related to the planned restructuring of RCA/BNA Nashville stood in the way.\n\nIn the meantime, Allan took a job selling cars. He left a demo tape in the glove box of a car purchased by a wealthy couple. When the couple discovered that he was the singer, they wrote him a check for $12,000. This independent funding allowed Allan to go to Nashville to record some of the songs that were on that early demo tape with Hill as producer. On September 11, 1995, they worked at Javelina Studios for a couple of days on the four songs that Hill immediately showed to labels. Allan's recordings brought serious responses from several labels including Mercury, RCA, and Decca. A meeting was then held at a Nashville hotel among Hill, Allan, and friend of Allan's, who was a program director for a radio station in California, to arrange two showcases in Los Angeles, California, to put Allan on stage at two of the radio station's regular nights at a local club. Byron arranged for staffers at the Nashville office of Decca Records to attend the first showcase held on November 1, 1995. Decca immediately wanted to sign Allan, and knowing that Byron was lining up other labels to see Gary, Decca asked them to cancel the second showcase. A rep from RCA was already booked to see the second showcase the following week, but the \"bird-in-hand\" deal offer was too tempting for both Hill and Allan, so they committed to the Decca offer. \n\nHis first deal, with Decca Records Nashville, produced the 1996 album Used Heart for Sale. The album was named \"Best of the Month\" by Stereo Review. It advanced to the top 20 of the charts, and produced a Top 10 country hit with the track Her Man (previously recorded by Waylon Jennings). Other tracks from the album, however, proved less successful.\n\nHis second album, It Would Be You, was released in 1998. Although Allan had been writing songs since he was a teenager, he does not hesitate to bump his work from his albums in favor of those written by other songwriters he respects. For his second album, Allan replaced one of his songs with No Judgement Day, written by Allen Shamblin. Although the song was a hidden acoustic track, radio stations began giving it heavy airplay. The song tells the story of a shopkeeper in Texas, whose children killed him in search of money. The title track of the album became Allan's second top 10 hit of the year, remaining in the top 10 after 21 weeks of radio play, \"way beyond the tenure of most disposable radio hits.\" At the beginning of 1999, Decca Records folded, and when Allan moved to the parent label, MCA Nashville, It Would Be You was left in limbo.\n\nIn 1999, Allan released Smoke Rings in the Dark, an album he recorded while in the midst of a divorce from his second wife, Versace model Danette Day, after only seven months of marriage. Unlike his first two albums, Smoke Rings in the Dark made fuller use of background singers and stringed instruments, \"resulting in a lusher, fuller sound.\" The new album avoided the \"devil-may-care brashness\" of the first two, instead presenting a tone balanced between youthful optimism and \"the knowledge that some of life's experiences exact a high toll.\" Smoke Rings in the Dark was certified platinum, and it included two successful singles.\n\nIn 2001 the album Alright Guy was released. It contained the singles The One, Man of Me, and Man to Man, the latter of which became his first Billboard No. 1 hit. The same year, Allan married for the third time, to Angela, a flight attendant he met on an airplane.\n\nDespite his previous success and eight years in the music business, Allan was nominated for the Country Music Association's Horizon Award, typically given to newcomers, in 2003. The same year he released his fifth album, See If I Care. Allan had to fight to keep the title, which he felt epitomized his attitude towards the music business, that he would continue to make the music that he wanted to make regardless of whether the record label chose to back him or people chose to buy the album. See If I Care included his second and third Number One singles, Tough Little Boys and Nothing On but the Radio. Songs About Rain was a top 15 hit.\n\nIn 2003, Allan and his wife, Angela Herzberg, moved to Tennessee from California. On October 25, 2004, Angela Herzberg committed suicide after suffering from depression and migraines. Allan initially put his career on hold, but soon turned to music to deal with the loss of his wife. This resulted in 2005's \"heart-wrenchingly personal album,\" Tough All Over. He included several songs which he wrote or cowrote, including Puttin' Memories Away and I Just Got Back from Hell, which dealt directly with his grief. Several years later, Gary discussed his wife's suicide on The Oprah Winfrey Show.\n\nTough All Over sold over 99,000 copies in its first week, debuting at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the magazine's Top Country Albums chart. It was subsequently certified gold by the RIAA as of December 20, 2006, and contained the top 10 singles Best I Ever Had (written by Vertical Horizon's Matt Scannell) and Life Ain't Always Beautiful, co-written by country singer Cyndi Thomson (under the name Cyndi Goodman).\n\nAllan's first Greatest Hits collection was released on March 6, 2007. A Number One album on the Billboard Top Country Albums charts, the album reprised the greatest hits from his first six albums, as well as two new songs. One of these, titled A Feelin' Like That, was co-written by David Lee Murphy and Ira Dean (the latter a former member of Trick Pony); the single peaked at #12 on the country singles charts.\n\nAllan's album titled Living Hard, was released on October 23, 2007. Serving as its lead-off single was the song Watching Airplanes, which spent more than thirty weeks on the country charts, where it reached a peak of #2 and went #1 on the Mediabase Chart. The song's music video was filmed during live concerts, including one at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado. Second single Learning How to Bend – co-written by Allan – quickly became another hit song, peaking at #13. The video was filmed during a live performance at the House of Blues in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Following this song is third single She's So California, which Allan co-wrote with Jaime Hanna (of Hanna-McEuen) and Jon Randall, and it peaked at #24, becoming his first single to miss the top 20 since Lovin' You Against My Will in 2000.\n\nToday was released on June 12, 2009, serving as the lead-off single to Allan's studio album, Get Off on the Pain, which was released on March 9, 2010. Title track, Get Off on the Pain, was the album's second single. It debuted at #42 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, the highest-debuting single of his career. Kiss Me When I'm Down the album's third single released to radio in 2010. It debuted at #52 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nhttp://www.garyallan.com/pain/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Allan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Dead Can Dance is an Australian musical project formed in 1981 in Melbourne by Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry. The band relocated to London, England, in May 1982. Australian music historian Ian McFarlane described Dead Can Dance's style as \"constructed soundscapes of mesmerizing grandeur and solemn beauty; African polyrhythms, Gaelic folk, Gregorian chant, Middle Eastern mantras, and art rock.\"\n\nHaving disbanded in 1998, they reunited briefly in 2005 for a world tour and reformed in 2011, releasing a new album (Anastasis) and embarking on several tours.\n\nDead Can Dance formed in Melbourne, Australia in August 1981 with Paul Erikson on bass guitar, Lisa Gerrard (ex-Microfilm) on vocals, Simon Monroe (Marching Girls) on drums and Brendan Perry (also of Marching Girls) on vocals and guitar. Gerrard and Perry were a couple who met as members of Melbourne's little band scene. In May 1982, the band left Monroe in Australia and moved to London, England, where they signed with alternative rock label 4AD. With the duo, the initial United Kingdom line-up were Paul Erikson and Peter Ulrich.\n\nThe group's debut album, Dead Can Dance, was released in February 1984. The artwork, which depicts a ritual mask from New Guinea, \"provide a visual reinterpretation of the meaning of the name Dead Can Dance\", set in a faux Greek typeface. The album featured \"drum-driven, ambient guitar music with chanting, singing and howling\", and fit in with the ethereal wave style of label mates Cocteau Twins. They followed with a four-track extended play, Garden of the Arcane Delights in August. AllMusic described their early work as \"as goth as it gets\" (despite the group themselves rejecting the label), while the EP saw them \"plunging into a wider range of music and style\".\n\nA shift in sound followed for the Spleen and Ideal album, with more emphasis on strings, brass and drones being used. A quasi spiritual element also emerged on this album, notably on the opening tracks \"De Profundis\" and \"Ascension\". Its worth noting that around this time Lisa and Brendan had been doing tours of European Cathedrals, absorbing the ambience which in turn was reflected in the work.\n\nThe highlights of the bands career followed with the genre defining album Within The Realm of a Dying Sun, featuring fan favorite \"Cantara\", which is where the bands Arabic and World music influences began to appear, and the double whammy of \"Summoning of the Muse\" and \"Persephone (The Gathering of Flowers).\" Critics at the time were undecided about the album, mainly due to the fact that the pieces were split according to the vocals. Brendan had the first side of the album, where Lisa took over for the latter half. \n\nThe Serpent's Egg was the next album and built on the premise set by the previous album, although the album is slightly uneven in quality and a short listen at around 40 minutes. The album is redeemed by the opening and closing pieces \"The Host of Seraphim\", and Perry's epic \"Ullyses\".\n\nFor the next album Aion, the band slipped back several centuries and recreated working medieval instruments such as the Sackbut, Viol and Hurdy Gurdy for the distinctly Medieval flavor. Included on the album is \"Song of the sibyl\" a text from 14th century Spain and now a live favorite. Another text appears in the song \"Fortune Presents Gifts Not According To The Book\". \n\nInto the Labyrinth was the follow up album and was the album that saw Brendan mastering the use of samples and synthesizers and also the album that brought the band's music to  American audiences selling over a million copies worldwide. The track \"The Ubiquitous Mr Lovegrove\" was played across on college radio and was instrumental in the albums success.\n\nSpiritchaser was the seventh studio album for the band and brought about an abrupt upturn in musical style, instead of drawing on the historical past the band drew upon South American and African influences which gave the album a very rhythmic ambience. Considered by some to be the bands weakest album, it features highlights such as the percussive \"Nierika\" which was the most played track on American college radio for that year, and the epic 9 minute trance inducing \"Indus\".\n\nA 3 CD retrospective simply called 1981-1998 was issued by 4AD and compiled a comprehensive overview of the bands career, and provided diehard fans with the only finished track from the Spiritchaser follow-up sessions called \"The Lotus Eaters\".\n\nAs a live band is probably where Dead Can Dance have gained their reputation. To put it simply, they were phenomenal. The concerts often featured many improvised pieces that to date have never been recorded in the studio. A live album entitled Toward the Within was released in 1994 and allowed fans unfortunate enough to have not attended concerts the chance to hear a few of these songs. A companion video/DVD of the concert was also released allowing people to see these highly ethereal concerts. \n\nAfter Dead Can Dance ceased to be a functioning band both Perry and Gerrard embarked upon solo careers. To date, Brendan has released one solo album The Eye of the Hunter and has completed work on a new album, 'Ark', to be released in June 2010, whilst Lisa has been more prolific but with mixed results, releasing two solo albums The Mirror Pool and The Silver Tree. Lisa has also collaborated with other artists, namely Pieter Bourke of the band Soma and Irish composer Patrick Cassidy on the respective albums Duality and Immortal Memory. Lisa has also become a sought after soundtrack artist too after a wave of publicity for the Ridley Scott film Gladiator and continues to release work on a regular basis including soundtrack work on Ali, Layer Cake, and Whale Rider. Peter Ulrich, former percussionist of the band has also released two solo albums, Pathways and Dawns and more recently, Enter the Mysterium.\n\nA series of 31 reunion concerts took place in 2005 in both Europe and North America including two memorable sell out concerts at The Hollywood Bowl and Radio City accompanied by 40 piece orchestras. Many of these concerts were professionally recorded and released as a double CD.\n\nIn late 2011, the band announced a reunion World Tour, in order to promote their new album, fittingly titled Anastasis, as it was released on August 9, 2012, 16 years after the group's previous album. Anastasis was well received by critics and is also the first album of the band not released by 4AD Records.\n\nThe name \"Dead Can Dance\" is often misleading. Although this group is quite popular among the goth sub-culture with the name appearing to be inspired by the Danse macabre allegory, it should instead be interpreted as 'giving life to something that was previously inanimate' as Perry said:\n\n\"The album artwork [of our self titled first album], a ritual mask from New Guinea, attempted to provide a visual reintrepretation of the meaning of the name \"Dead Can Dance.\" The mask, though once a living part of a tree is dead; nevertheless it has, through the artistry of its maker, been imbued with a life force of its own. To understand why we chose the name, think of the transformation of inanimacy to animacy.... Think of the processes concerning life from death and death into life. So many people missed the inherent symbolism, and assumed that we must be 'morbid gothic types,' a mistake we deplored and deplore...\".\n\nhttp://www.deadcandance.com\n http://www.facebook.com/DeadCanDanceOfficial\nhttps://twitter.com/DCDmusic <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Can+Dance\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Orchard Lounge is a collective of DJs and close friends that formed in Chicago, IL, USA in 2000. The trio of Ben Silver, Spencer Lokken, and Bethany Lokken, focus on performing for the more discerning of dance floors, and are known to appeal to open-minded and diverse audiences. They've never let their passion for the beat confine them to a single genre, as their sets may include anything from laid back downtempo/IDM to hypnotic tech house and b-boy era electro. Don't be surprised if you hear an entire night of music dedicated to the sounds that have heavily influenced them as DJs either: they all share an affinity for classic hip hop, rock, funk, and soul, as well. This is the reasoning behind \"OL: From the Dance Floor to the Couch\". It's the appropriate defining phrase for the group because of their innate programming and record selection skills, as well as their talents in creating an experience for most any state of mind or environment. Some may label this as being versatile, however the three simply consider themselves serious music lovers with similar, albeit eclectic, interests. At the very core, they're highly enthusiastic individuals full of praise for the producers whose names appear on their records. To that end, they've always fully understood their role as middlemen (and woman!), and if they are to accept the coveted role of tastemaker, they want it to soley benefit the artists whom they all admire.\n\nOrchard Lounge currently holds down a number of Chicago residencies at spots like Funky Buddha Lounge, Lava Lounge, Metro and Moonshine. They are constantly looking for new opportunities to play records for those who appreciate music that may be a bit off the beaten path, and are always open to new ideas that will break down the barriers of dance music. Recently, the three have been playing alongside like-minded bands like The Disco Biscuits and Future Rock, where OL will segue into the band's live instrumentation, and vice-versa. This creates a unique experience for concertgoers, and maintains a general flow throughout the evening, essentially abolishing the idea of a typical show's set break. These types of events set Orchard Lounge apart from other DJs and collectives, and allow for a wider range of bookings in both nightclubs and live music venues. Never ones to sing high praise of club culture, the trio couldn't be happier with the opportunities that have arisen because of this unique trait.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Orchard+Lounge\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Some people say luck is the intersection of hard work and opportunity. On their fourth studio album Take Good Care (Loma Vista Recordings), the New Orleans chart-topping rock band deliver a bevy of anthems marked by moments of sonic complexity, celebration, and catharsis, chronicling an unbelievable ride that unassumingly commenced in 2008 with hundreds of underground shows yearly. Ten years of tireless hard work would be unexpectedly revved up by the success of the platinum-selling number one smash “Wish I Knew You,” and like any enduring band worth its salt, the octet buckled down and turned up with an album chock full of tunes worthy of even greater success, such as the #1 Triple A and Top 5 Alternative single \"All My Friends\" and new #1 Triple A and Top 15 Alternative hit single “Change.” The Revivalists – David Shaw [lead vocals, guitar], Zack Feinberg [guitar], Andrew Campanelli [drums], George Gekas [bass], Ed Williams [pedal steel guitar], Rob Ingraham [saxophone], Michael Girardot [keyboard, trumpet], and PJ Howard [drums, percussion]— have garnered more than 300 million total streams, have drawn praise from the likes of Rolling Stone, Billboard, Buzzfeed, Entertainment Weekly, USA Today, Salon, HuffPost, Grammy.com, Alternative Press, Uproxx, Flaunt, Nylon, and more, and have performed on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel LIVE!, Ellen, TODAY and Conan, with an upcoming appearance on Austin City Limits. They were nominated for a Billboard Music Award and two iHeartRadio Music Awards, were named Billboard’s Top New Rock Artist of 2017 and have three years of back-to-back sold out headline tours in their biggest venues to date. In the end, The Revivalists welcome listeners on this journey with them as they set out with a newfound depth and ambition. “We’re in this together,” says Shaw. “We love to take people on an emotional rollercoaster with us. That’s what this record is. It’s who we are. There’s some real magic in that.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Revivalists\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "On Jan 10th, 2012 the Santa Barbara, CA based band Rebelution released \"Peace of Mind\" through their own label 87 Music in partnership with Controlled Substance Sound Labs. Peace of Mind was released as a multi-length triple album which includes Peace of Mind: Acoustic as well as Peace of Mind: Dub. Marking the highest chart debut of Rebelution’s career, Peace of Mind debuted at #13 on the Billboard Top 200, #1 Reggae and #1 Independent albums as well as #4 on the iTunes overall album chart. The band previously had four top 10 albums on the Reggae chart and their 2009 release Bright Side of Life debuted at No. 54 on the Top 200 and #1 Reggae.\n\nRebelution kicked off their “Peace of Mind Tour” the day after the release, selling out shows at Philly’s The Electric Factory, The Hollywood Palladium, Denver’s The Fillmore, The Fox Theater in Oakland and Hard Rock in Orlando, FL. The tour made stops in a total of 42 cities across the country.\n\nSummer 2012 was spent supporting O.A.R on their Amphitheatre tour, headlining four amphitheaters in Florida as well as festival performances at Outside Lands, Hangout, Forecastle, Summer Camp, Summer Set, The Allman Bro’s Peach Festival and two performances at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. After completing a Fall tour of the East and South East, Rebelution will be headlining The Hollywood Palladium on New Years Eve, heading to New Zealand for the Raggamuffins Festival in February and headlining their annual Winter Greens Tour around the USA in Feb - May 2013. \n\nPeace of Mind marks the first time Rebelution has expanded beyond their usual self-production enlisting producers Michael Goldwasser (Easy Star All-Stars), Amp Live (Zion-I), Yeti Beats (Kool Keith, George Clinton), Keith Armstrong and Errol Brown (Stephen, Ziggy, Damian, and Bob Marley). The album builds upon the band’s signature style while venturing into new musical genres from the lush strings incorporated into the gentle “Route Around” to the driving guitar and synths throughout “Lady In White”.\n\nRebelution has developed into a front-runner for grassroots, independent and tour driven music groups. Originally formed in 2004, members Eric Rachmany (vocals / guitar), Rory Carey (keyboards), Wesley Finley (drums), and Marley D. Williams (bass) met in college, while residing in Isla Vista, a popular beachside community in Santa Barbara. It was there that the seeds to Rebelution’s future were planted creating inspiring and engaging music that would leave their listeners with the sense that they have the power to make this world a better place. The band continuously tours across the country, ventured to South America and Europe, and has previously performed at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits among others.\n \nContact:\nManagement:  Silverback Artist Management / Raise Up Music\nDean Raise – dean@raiseupentertainment.com\nJon Phillips – Jon@silverbackmusic.net\n \nBooking – Paradigm Agency\nAaron Pinkus – apinkus@paradigmagency.com\n \nJamie Simone\nPFA Media\njsimone@pfamedia.net\n212-334-6116 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rebelution\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Local Natives (formerly cavil at rest) is an indie rock band based in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, CA, United States.\nAfter the three founding members originally met in high school, a bassist and a drummer were found, and they all moved to a house in Silver Lake in 2008 to record their album. Their debut album as Local Natives, \"Gorilla Manor\", was released in the UK on November 2nd, 2009, and saw a US release date of February 16th, 2010. The band's sound has been described as \"afropop-influenced guitars with hyperactive drumming and hooky three-part harmonies\". They started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Initial reviews of Local Natives have drawn favourable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend.\n\nUtilizing lots of vocal harmonies and drifting, dreamlike melodies, Local Natives have an intricate sound based around the delicate interconnectedness of all of their parts. This gives the band a sound that is able to be orchestral while still feeling understated, evoking the carefully assembled pop of Grizzly Bear. Their debut, Gorilla Manor, arrived in 2009 through U.K. label Infectious Records (with a domestic release coming by way of Frenchkiss in 2010). In 2011, Andy Hamm left Local Natives, leaving them to continue on as a quartet. In 2013, the band returned with its sophomore album, Hummingbird, featuring the single \"Breakers\".\n\nOfficial website: http://www.localnatives.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Local+Natives\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The Flaming Lips are an American neo-psychedelic band, formed in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States in 1983. Throughout their career, band members have come and gone, but currently The Flaming Lips consist of original members Wayne Coyne (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards) and Michael Ivins (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), along with members Steven Drozd (drums, guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), and Derek Brown (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals). Former members include Mark Coyne (lead vocals), Richard English (drums, keyboards, backing vocals), Nathan Roberts (drums), Jonathan Donahue (guitar, backing vocals), who went on to form Mercury Rev, Ronald Jones (guitar, backing vocals), and Kliph Scurlock (drums).\n\nThe Flaming Lips are known for their lush, multi-layered arrangements, spacey lyrics and bizarre song titles. They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which typically feature animal suits, puppets, streamers, video projections and complex stage light configurations.\n\nIn 2002, Q magazine named The Flaming Lips one of the \"50 Bands to See Before You Die\". In 2006, Oklahoma City named a street Flaming Lips Alley in their honor.\n\nThe group recorded several albums and EPs for Restless Records in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a #9 hit on the Billboard Alternative charts (and #55 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart)  in 1994 with \"She Don't Use Jelly\". Although it would be their only hit single, the band has maintained critical respect and, to a lesser extent, commercial viability with sonically majestic albums such as 1995's Clouds Taste Metallic, 1999's The Soft Bulletin, 2002's Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots and 2006's At War with the Mystics. The Flaming Lips' 12th studio album, Embryonic, was released in October of 2009. A complete cover of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon was released in May 2010. The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends, their collaborative album which features artists like Ke$ha, Bon Iver, Nick Cave and Erykah Badu, was released on Record Store Day, April 2012. \n\nTheir next studio album, tentatively titled The Terror, will be released in January 2013.\n\nTheir song \"Do You Realize??\" is the official State Rock Song of Oklahoma.\n\nwww.flaminglips.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Flaming+Lips\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "\nGin Blossoms are an alternative rock/power pop band that formed in 1987, in Tempe, Arizona, United States, known for their melodic yet melancholic sound. The band originally consisted of Robin Wilson (vocals, guitar), Jesse Valenzuela (guitar, vocals), Doug Hopkins (guitar),  Bill Leen (bass), and Phillip Rhodes (drums). Shortly after finishing their debut major album, 'New Miserable Experience', the band fired Hopkins (who was also the band's principal songwriter and penned their hits \"Found Out About You\" and \"Hey Jealousy\") and replaced him with Scott Johnston.\n\nReleased on August 4, 1992, 'New Miserable Experience' proved a sonic contrast to the grunge and aggressive hard rock inspired music in vogue at the time. It became a strong commercial success, reaching the #1 spot on Billboard's Heatseekers chart. Aforementioned hits \"Found Out About You\" and \"Hey Jealousy\" were top 40 smashes on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, still getting consistent radio airplay as the years went on.\n\nThough blessed with songwriting talent, Hopkins struggled both with addiction and with major depression. Sadly, Hopkins committed suicide in December of 1993. The band continued without him and achieved more major success, their power pop inspired, emotional lyrics becoming a precursor to later adult alternative groups of the late 90s and 00s. Still, they experienced more line-up changes, as Rhodes left the band shortly after their 2002 reunion (returning for a brief period in 2005). Currently the band does not have a permanent drummer.  \n\nThey took their name from a photo of W.C. Fields which bore the caption \"W.C. Fields with gin blossoms,\" referring to the actor's gin-ravaged nose. The band, who were musically weaned on rock artists such as The Byrds and Tom Petty, released three albums and had several hits in the mid-90s before breaking up in 1997. Five years later in 2002, the band reunited, released a DVD, resumed touring, and promised a fourth album.\n\nTitled 'Major Lodge Victory', the Gin Blossoms' first album in ten years was released on August 8, 2006 on the Hybrid Recordings label. They have done much well-received touring since then. For example, the group joined Everclear, Sugar Ray, Lit and Marcy Playground on the 'Summerland Tour 2012', a 31-date nationwide tour that began on June 28, 2012, in Saratoga, California, and ended on August 11, 2012, in Laughlin, Nevada. The band later released 'No Chocolate Cake' on September 28, 2010; and  'Mixed Reality' on June 15, 2018. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gin+Blossoms\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Actively involved with music since the age of five, when he took up the violin -- in high school, he was a New York all-state performer -- he started making tracks during his teens. In his early twenties, as Jai Wolf, his style stabilized as he gained notice for his remix work. An unauthorized version of Skrillex's \"Ease My Mind\" impressed the original's maker enough to facilitate a partnership with the OWSLA label. Saha's own track, the bubbly \"Indian Summer,\" was issued on Foreign Family Collective in 2015 and reached number 31 on Billboard's Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart that December. The wistful \"Drive,\" featuring the Chain Gang of 1974, followed in 2016.

    "headlinerBio": "     Using the rich musical landscapes of Boulder and Denver Colorado as their muse, The Motet has mastered the delicate task of constantly reinventing their sound while staying true to their various roots. Founded in 1998 by Dave Watts, The Motet has become one of the best improvisational bands touring . Their ability to seamlessly fuse elements of afro-beat, electronica, funk, and jazz has led to a sound that defies categorization.\n\n     The Motet is a world-class ensemble that whips audiences into a whirling frenzy using sheer impromptu force. With their spontaneous and textured rhythms and hard-driving beats, the band creates a repertoire between themselves and the audiences that is rarely seen in today's manufactured rock. The Motet consecrates the ground on which dance music meets free-form improvisation, allowing a diverse audience to become immersed in their eclectic sound. \"Our tendency to avoid being pigeon-holed is a reflection of who we are as musicians,\" said Watts. \"We try to be open-minded about how we approach different genres and traditions.\"\n\n     With its 6th release, Dig Deep, The Motet once again proves that it is a group\ncommitted to exploring and pushing the sonic envelope, while still remaining committed\nto the musical traditions that have defined their sound. A heavy-horned afrobeat\ninfluence countered with a textural blanket of electronica, this album showcases the\ntalents and strengths of the cast of characters that drummer and producer Dave Watts has\nassembled. Keyboardist Joey Porter lays down the funk under the coursing melodies of\nsaxophonist Dominic Lalli in pure Motet fashion, with the ever-driving beats of Watts’\nmasterful rhythmic production pushing the music through sonic peaks and valleys that\ntantalize and invigorate listeners. If you’ve loved The Motet for years or are just tuning\nin, listen up. You won’t be disappointed.\nThe Motet is known for its revolving musicians and a breadth of musical influences,\nand Dig Deep plays to the strengths of many former and current members. Bassists\nGarrett Sayers and Paul McDaniel both shine brilliantly on Dig Deep, adding the sonic\ndrive that is characteristic of The Motet’s sound, which has steadily morphed and evolved\nover the last ten years. Sayers’ bass solo on ‘Guru’ is a perfect example of his technical\nvirtuosity, and with this, Watts as a producer has captured a quintessential Motet\nmoment. The title track ‘Dig Deep’ showcases another side of The Motet low-end,\nheavy-bass sound, with McDaniel laying down raw grooves in an open section that is\npeppered with Watts’ sonic explorations.\nLongtime fans of The Motet will be happy to hear Jans Ingber’s voice on ‘Push,’ a\ntrack that was born from an improvisational moment during the band’s New Years 2009\nshow. Last featured on The Motet’s 2000 release Play, Beth Quist’s soaring vocals are\nhighlighted on the Fela Kuti track ‘Kalakuta Show’ and the tune ‘The Luxury of Doubt,’\na collaborative effort with Watts. Throughout Dig Deep, percussionist Scott\nMessersmith adds his signature textural rhythms, anchoring the evolutionary sound of the\nband in its Afro-Cuban and West African roots. His contributions are particularly salient\nin the afrobeat tunes ‘Mighty’ and ‘Roforofo Fight.” Guitarists Mike Tiernan and\nZivanni Masango both add their talents on Dig Deep, as do Danny Sears on trumpet and\nJohn Stuart on baritone saxophone.\nWith this mix of talented musicians contributing to the album, it is no wonder that Dig\nDeep sounds as good as it does. But at the helm is drummer Dave Watts, simultaneously\nembodying the roles of bandleader, musician, composer, and producer. It is Watts’\ncreative imagination that drives Dig Deep, mixing recorded and sampled tracks that\nseamlessly carry the music forward throughout the album. As a drummer, Watts has\nbeen called “the human metronome.” His sense of timing and polyrhythmic\nunderstanding is what has made him a force in the live music scene for over twenty years.\nDig Deep is his most in-depth exploration into production work thus far. Watts has\namply represented the layered electronica-funk vibe that has begun to characterize The\nMotet’s sound over the last few years, and he has truly “dug deep” to bring you Dig\nDeep.\n           Dig Deep is available for FREE DOWNLOAD at myspace.com/themotetmusic <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Motet\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The String Cheese Incident (SCI) is a US jam band formed in Crested Butte, Colorado in 1993. The band's music has elements of bluegrass as well as rock, electronica, calypso, country, funk, jazz, Latin, progressive rock, reggae, and occasional psychedelia. All members write original compositions and sing.\n\nFrom playing local gigs at ski resorts in exchange for free lift tickets, the band is composed of Michael Kang (acoustic/electric mandolin, electric guitar, and violin), Michael Travis (drums and percussion), Bill Nershi (acoustic guitar, lap steel guitar, and electric slide guitar), Kyle Hollingsworth (piano, organ, Rhodes, and accordion), and Keith Moseley (bass guitar), and, in 2006, Jason Hann (auxiliary percussion).\n\nThe String Cheese Incident has been described as a democratic ensemble rather than a band, since all of the members contribute their own original compositions to the group’s burgeoning library and share the vocal burden on a number of cover versions as well as their own songs.

Rather than doing business on such terms as “the bottom line,” The String Cheese Incident put their music and their fans first, opening companies of their own, including a ticketing company, a merchandise company and a fan travel agency, to best serve their community. The band’s record label, SCI Fidelity Records, has always operated under the same ideals. Even early on, SCI Fidelity embraced downloadable music and file sharing, delivering SCI’s “On the Road” series, where every show the band plays is made available for download on the internet.

Today, literally hundreds of bands are using some version of this same approach to building a band.  \n \nThe String Cheese Incident’s commitment goes well beyond their immediate community, and even beyond the music community as a whole.

    "headlinerBio": "Ari Staprans Leff (born August 8, 1994), known by his stage name Lauv, is an American musician. His debut EP titled Lost in the Light was released in 2015. He is best known for his 2017 single, I Like Me Better & The Other which charted at #17 in Billboard's Spotify Velocity.\n\nInterested in music from a young age, the San Francisco-born Leff took piano and viola lessons as a child before picking up the guitar around age 11. During high school, he played in several bands and studied jazz before discovering electronic music production. However, it was while attending N.Y.U. as a music tech major in 2014 that a bad breakup found Leff on his own and digging deep into his writing and recording process. Out of this period came the song \"The Other,\" co-written with songwriter/instrumentalist Michael Matosic. Released under Leff's stage name Lauv (inspired by the Latvian \"lauve\" or lion), the song went viral after gaining blog attention and peaked at number three on blog aggregator Hype Machine. In 2015 he returned with his debut EP, Lost in the Light, which featured \"The Other.\"\n\nMore tracks followed, including 2015's \"Reforget\" and 2016's \"Question,\" featuring Travis Mills. In 2017 Lauv headed his own Late Nights, Deep Talks tour and premiered the official video for \"The Other,\" along with a series of remixes. Released in May of that year, Lauv's single \"I Like Me Better\" became a breakout international hit and was later featured on his self-titled second EP that October. The single was also included on his full-length debut, 2018's I Met You When I Was 18, which also featured the singles \"Paranoid\" and \"Bracelet.\" Hit collaborations with Julia Michaels (\"There's No Way\") and Troye Sivan (\"I'm So Tired...\") carried him into 2019. Lauv's debut album \"~how i'm feeling~\" is set to be released in March 2020. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lauv\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group released their debut album, The 1975 on 2 September 2013 and their second album, I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it was released on 26 February 2016.\n\nThe band has also released five EPs: Facedown EP (2012), Sex EP (2012), Music for Cars EP (2013), IV (2013), and a US version of \"IV\" with a significantly altered track listing (2013).\n\nIn 2018, they released the 15 track \"A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships,\" described by Pitchfork as their \"outrageous and eclectic third album [that] attests to the worth of putting in an honest effort in the face of near-constant gloom.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+1975\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Sublime with Rome is a collaboration between Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh of Sublime and Rome Ramirez. Vocalist and guitarist Rome Ramirez joined Wilson and Gaugh to perform classic material and eventually originals. It became clear that Ramirez could not replace Sublime's late lead singer and guitarist, Bradley Nowell, who died in 1996 but legally, he would simply be \"featured with\" former Sublime members. \n\nSublime with Rome performed their first gig together in February 2009 near Gaugh's home in Nevada, followed by an appearance at Cypress Hill's Smokeout Festival in San Bernadino that October. On April 20, 2010, the band embarked on their first-ever US tour with dates going into that fall. After positive reaction on the road, Sublime with Rome released a debut album on Fueled By Ramen records in July 2011. \n\nIn December 2011, Bud Gaugh revealed in an interview that he would be leaving Sublime With Rome and KROQ's Accoustic Christmas would be his last show. He saying he wanted to go home and spend more time with his family.  He later went on to say  \"It was really good for the first few months, after that, it just felt wrong. Not playing the songs but playing them with the name Sublime, without Brad.\" When asked if he saw the band reuniting in the future Gaugh replied \"No, I am done with SWR. I would be into playing music with Eric Wilson, however.\" He was replaced by Josh Freese. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sublime+with+Rome\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Nickelback is a rock band which formed in Hanna, Alberta, Canada in 1995. Nickelback is one of the most commercially successful Canadian groups, having sold 30 million records worldwide. Nickelback ranks as the 11th best selling music act of the 2000s, and places as the 2nd best selling foreign act in the US behind The Beatles for the 2000s.\n\nThe band consists of Chad Kroeger (vocals, guitar), Ryan Peake (guitar, vocals), Mike Kroeger (bass) and Daniel Adair (drums). The band's original drummer, Brandon Kroeger, left the group in 1997, and was replaced first by Mitch Guidon from 1997 to 1998 and then Ryan Vikedal from 1998 to 2005. The band has released seven albums: \"Curb\" (1996), \"The State\" (1998), \"Silver Side Up\" (2001), \"The Long Road\" (2003), \"All the Right Reasons\", \"Dark Horse\" (2008), \"Here and Now\" (2011) and \"Feed The Machine\" (2017).\n\nThe band is now based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Its name originates from the nickel in change that band member Mike Kroeger gave customers at his Starbucks job, he would frequently say, \"Here's your nickel back\".\n\nThe band is signed to EMI in Canada and Roadrunner Records for the rest of the world. In July 2008, the band signed with Live Nation for three touring and album cycles, with an option for a fourth cycle. The contract includes recordings, touring, merchandise and other rights.\n\n\nEarly years: 1995–2000\n\nThe band was formed in the early 1990s as a cover band called the \"Village Idiots\" by Chad Kroeger, Ryan Peake, Mike Kroeger, and Brandon Kroeger. The band performed covers of songs from Led Zeppelin and Metallica. Nickelback's first release was a seven-track EP called Hesher in 1996. In the same year, Nickelback recorded their first full-length album Curb. \"Fly\" was released on Hesher and Curb and was the first single produced by Nickelback. It did not chart and was only played on local radio stations.\n\nThe following album The State was recorded in 1998 and was released as an independent record the same year. Nickelback signed a record deal with EMI and Roadrunner Records. The State was then re-released in 2000 by EMI and Roadrunner Records. Two singles from the album, \"Leader of Men\" and \"Breathe\" were fairly successful and resulted in the album being certificated gold in Canada and the United States. It was certified Platinum in 2008.\n\nMainstream success: 2001–2007\n\nIn 2001, Nickelback released the Silver Side Up album, which propelled them into the mainstream. The single \"How You Remind Me\" was a huge success, peaking at #1 on both the American and Canadian charts at the same time. In the U.S., it was a #1 single on the Mainstream and Modern rock charts, as well as the pop chart. It also peaked at #2 on Adult Top 40. \"How You Remind Me\" became the Billboard Hot 100 #1 single of the year for 2002. The next single was \"Too Bad\", which also hit #1 on the Mainstream Rock Chart and had a small amount of success on the pop chart. The final single from the album was \"Never Again\", another #1 hit on Mainstream Rock.\n\nIn 2002, Chad Kroeger collaborated with Josey Scott and Gaige Corvo who played the lead guitar on the Spider-Man theme song, \"Hero.\" This also featured Tyler Connolly, Mike Kroeger, Matt Cameron, and Jeremy Taggart.\n\nIn 2003, Nickelback released The Long Road. The lead single was \"Someday\" and the album went on to sell five million copies worldwide. The band also released \"Feelin' Way Too Damn Good\" as a single, which peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock Charts. \"Figured You Out\" was also released as a single and topped the Mainstream Rock Charts for 13 consecutive weeks.\n\nNickelback's fifth studio album, All the Right Reasons, produced five U.S. Hot 100 top 20 singles: \"Photograph\", \"Savin' Me\", \"Far Away\", \"If Everyone Cared\", \"Rockstar\". Three of these became U.S. Hot 100 top 10 singles. All the Right Reasons has sold 7,163,130 copies in the US as of June 13, 2009. In total, All the Right Reasons has sold abut 11 million copies worldwide since its 2005 release. Aside from all the success of All the Right Reasons, lead singer Kroeger began his own label named 604 Records in 2005 and holds the position of executive producer.\n\nDark Horse 2008-2010\n\nAfter taking much of 2007 off, the band started recording a new album in earnest. In July 2008, the band signed with Live Nation for three touring and album cycles, with an option for a fourth. \n\nOn September 4, 2008 Roadrunner Records announced that the first single from their upcoming album was originally going to be \"If Today Was Your Last Day\" and was to be released September 30, 2008. However, the song was scrapped as the first single, and \"Gotta Be Somebody\" was the lead single instead. The new album, titled Dark Horse, was released on November 18, 2008. The album was produced by Mutt Lange. Something in Your Mouth was released as the second single to rock radio only on December 15, where it reached #1. \"If Today Was Your Last Day\" was released as the second major single instead. Two more singles have been released,\"I'd Come for You\" and \"Burn It to the Ground\".\n\nThe album also remained in the top 20 on the Billboard 200 for weeks after its release. The album was certified two times platinum in April 2009, and had by April 2010 sold over 3 million copies in the U.S. However, critical reception of the album has been mostly mixed to negative. In 2009, the band won three Juno Awards for Juno Fan Choice Award, group of the year, and album of the year; the band performed their single \"Something In Your Mouth\" at the ceremony. In 2010, Billboard year end charts listed Dark Horse as the top-selling rock and metal album of the year. The band was also listed at the top selling hard rock artist. On January 29, 2010 they released a Tap-Tap rhythm game for on the App Store, contrary to the band's prior comments against other music related video games such as Guitar Hero. On February 28, 2010, Nickelback gave a performance at the beginning of the concert portion of the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony, performing \"Burn It to the Ground\". On October 2010 Nickelback finished their Dark Horse Tour.\n\nHere and Now 2011-present\nChad Kroeger said in an interview with Billboard.com in September 2010 that songwriting for the next Nickelback album was planned to commence as early as February 2011 with \"about four tunes\" already in mind. Adair mentioned that the band wanted to go back to the musical style of All The Right Reasons, which he described as \"more organic.\"\n\nNickelback announced their new album, Here and Now, on September 8, 2011, along with its two lead singles, \"Bottoms Up\" and \"When We Stand Together\". Kroeger said “We’re four people who love making music, the way we like to make it. We entered the studio this year with a vision, and it all came together. We’re extremely happy with the results, and can’t wait to share them with our fans.” The album was released on November 21, 2011, with the band calling it \"Nickelblack Monday\", a play on Nickelback and Black Monday. Two singles were released to radio stations on September 26, and September 27 for purchase on iTunes.\n\nHere and Now peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 226,714 copies in its first week of release, with Christmas by Michael Bublé taking number one by a margin of only 419 copies\n\nAccording to an interview with Chad Kroeger, the band planned to release a greatest hits album in 2013 and a new album in 2014. The band officially announced the compilation album The Best of Nickelback Volume 1 through social media on October 3, 2013. Frontman Chad Kroeger had previously stated in an interview that the greatest hits album was to feature songs from previous albums along with new songs but the unveiled track listing ultimately contained only previously released material.\n\nCriticism\n\nIn various points in their career, Nickelback has received widespread negative reviews from various sources. Review aggregator Metacritic reports the three of their most recent studio albums since becoming a mainstream act, The Long Road, All the Right Reasons and Dark Horse, to have scores of 62%, 41% and 49% respectively.\n\nThey have at times, been ridiculed for their lack of originality. In 2001, Rolling Stone criticised the band's musical style, saying, \"if you're looking for originality, you might want a full refund instead of a Nickelback.\" Rolling Stone also said their 2003 release, The Long Road, was \"Brazenly consistent, if unimaginative.\" Whilst Allmusic also stated, \"Nickelback can now afford a little more time in the studio and a little more time to indulge themselves, and they turn out the same record, only slicker, which only highlights just how oppressively and needlessly sullen this group is.\"\n\nIn 2005, Rolling Stone said \"All the Right Reasons is so depressing, you're almost glad Kurt's not around to hear it.\" Tiny Mix Tapes also expressed concern over the release; \"Like all Nickelback releases before it, All The Right Reasons was made for all the wrong ones and follows all the formulas and clichés you should be bored to death of by now.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewin of Allmusic reviewed Dark Horse, claiming that \"Nickelback are a gnarled, vulgar band reveling in their ignorance of the very notion of taste, lacking either the smarts or savvy to wallow in bad taste so they just get ugly, knocking out knuckle-dragging riffs that seem rarefied in comparison to their thick, boneheaded words.\"\n\nDespite a barrage from critics, Nickelback has still managed to please various sources with each of their mainstream albums. Allmusic reviewer Liana Jones complimented Nickelback after their commercial breakthrough, Silver Side Up; \"what gives the group an upper hand over its peers is intensity and raw passion... Nickelback ups the ante by offering realistic storytelling that listeners can relate to.\" Following their 2008 album, Dark Horse, ChartAttack credited the band's success to knowing their target audience, \"Chad Kroeger is a genius because he knows exactly what people want and precisely how far he can go. He turned out an extremely racy album that's loaded with songs about gettin' drunk and doin' it all without breaking any taboos, and with enough love and moral authority to grease its passage into the mainstream. Rejoice, North America. This is your world.\" Billboard also praised the band; \"The bulletproof Nickelback provides affordable fun that promises good returns in hard times.\"\n\nIn 2007, USA Today reported that \"few bands inspire such intense hatred as Nickelback.\" The article questioned whether Nickelback's commercial success made \"critics wrong\", and published multiple statements from various sources within the music industry. Nathan Brackett, a senior editor at Rolling Stone said, \"There are some bands that, let's face it, are critic-proof\". Both Brackett and Craig Marks, editor in chief of Blender, credit a lot of the band's success to young people who are introduced to them on the radio and \"very casual music fans who don't buy a lot of CDs\". Marks complimented Nickelback's popularity despite the critical response, saying \"it is a tribute to their success.\"\n\nList of Nickelback band members\n\nCurrent members\n* Chad Kroeger – lead vocals, lead guitar (1995–present)\n* Ryan Peake – rhythm guitar, keyboards, backing vocals (1995–present)\n* Mike Kroeger – bass guitar, backing vocals (1995–present)\n* Daniel Adair – drums, backing vocals (2005–present)\n\nFormer members\n* Brandon Kroeger – drums (1995–1997)\n* Mitch Guindon – drums (1997–1998)\n* Ryan Vikedal – drums (1998–2005)\n\nChad Kroeger was married to Avril Lavigne until 2015. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nickelback\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The Devil Makes Three is an Americana band from Santa Cruz, California, United States. The group blends bluegrass, old time, country, folk, blues, jazz, and ragtime music. The group's members are guitarist Pete Bernhard, upright bassist Lucia Turino, and guitarist and tenor banjo player Cooper McBean.\n\n“The rhythm is what our band is about.\" Says Pete Bernhard: Guitarist, Front Man. The Devil Makes Three are quite possibly the best band that you have never heard of. They have been constantly on tour, selling out dates across the country and in their neck of the woods on the West Coast drawing near capacity crowds nightly. This is all word of mouth. Over the years, the Devil Makes Three have garnered fans the old school way, playing a city, making friends, conquering fans and moving on.\n\nLaced with elements of ragtime, blues, country, folk and rockabilly, the critically praised, drummer-less trio - consisting of Vermont native, guitarist/front man Pete Bernhard, stand-up bassist Lucia Turino and guitarist Cooper McBean, also of rural Vermont - brings forth a genuine approach to acoustic music.  The sound is deeply steeped in rhythm and alive with three part harmonies, while keeping a slightly punk aesthetic to their music and especially their live shows.\n\nNote: the following songs belong to a different band with the same name, a small local metal band from Northern Ireland:\n\nA Lesson Unlearnt\nDead\nFeed the Greed\nHeaven Descent <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Devil+Makes+Three\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Umphrey's McGee is a progressive rock / jam band from South Bend, IN now based in Chicago, IL.\n\nThey are influenced musically by progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Dream Theater, and Genesis, as well as heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden. The band also identifies The Police, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences. However, there really isn't a style of popular music that Umphrey's does not cover. Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to Paul Simon.\n\nFormed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands. \n\nIn mid-1998, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as Divisions and All in Time.\n\nShortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.\n\nThe addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar). Another live album, One Fat Sucka, was released shortly after, containing live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.\n\nAround 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the \"Jimmy Stewart Ballroom\" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions \"Jimmy Stewart.\" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by \"McL\" in the \"Jimmy Stewart writeup\" on the fan message board known as \"The Bort\" at www.umphreaks.com.\n\n2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, Umphrey's was invited to play the first annual Bonnaroo Music Festival which took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date and ended up selling more CDs than any other artist on the bill including Widespread Panic, Trey Anastasio, and Norah Jones.\n\nIn October 2002 drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving to attend medical school. After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.  \n\nIn 2004, the band released the critically-acclaimed album Anchor Drops, recorded in several different studios throughout the Chicago area. Shortly before the release of the album, the band scored a distribution deal for both Anchor Drops and Local Band Does OK, and for the first time, Umphrey's music was available in stores all over the country. Anchor Drops received rave reviews from several high-profile magazines. Umphrey's was booked to play the Bonnaroo Music Festival once again in June but unlike their 2002 performance, this time they would play a coveted late-night spot. The band performed to over 20,000 people, many of whom had never heard the band before. Shortly after in July, Umphrey's was declared by Rolling Stone Magazine to \"have become odds-on favorites in the next-Phish sweepstakes.\" \n\nIn April 2006, Umphrey's released their fourth studio effort, Safety in Numbers. They appeared on the late night TV program Jimmy Kimmel Live in May and were featured at many of the major U.S. festivals throughout the summer, playing 129 shows before a three-night stand in Chicago for New Year's Eve. The Bottom Half, an album of leftover tracks from the Safety in Numbers sessions, was released a year later in April, 2007. It was supported with tours of the U.S., Europe, and Japan.  \n\nA live double-album titled Live at the Murat was released in October, 2007. The album was recorded over 2 nights at the Egyptian Room in the Murat Centre in Indianapolis, Indiana on April 6-7, 2007. It received a 4-star review from Rolling Stone Magazine. The album also won a Jammy for best live album. Another live double album release came in June 2008, when the band put out Jimmy Stewart 2007. The album consisted entirely of live, improvised \"Jimmy Stewart\" sessions recorded in 2007.\n\nUmphrey's McGee completed work on their next studio album, Mantis, in late 2008. Recorded mainly in Manny Sanchez’s I.V. Lab Studios in Chicago, the band members began by presenting each other with CDs containing hundreds of musical ideas they’d composed over the past dozen years, which were then shifted and trimmed down to the concise tracks that appear on the album. The band’s longtime sound caresser, Kevin Browning, edited and mixed the album's material. \n\nMantis became available for pre-order on October 27, 2008. Along with the pre-order announcement came information that unique bonus content would be available and more content would unlock depending on how many pre-orders were placed. This unusual method of distribution has been hailed as the \"perfect way to implement a pre-order campaign\" by Reuters.com.\n\nMantis was released on January 20, 2009. The album marked Umphrey’s second decade together as a band and was the first Umphrey’s album to consist entirely of material never previously performed on the road. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Umphrey%27s+McGee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.  \n\nIn 2004, the band released the critically-acclaimed album Anchor Drops, recorded in several different studios throughout the Chicago area. Shortly before the release of the album, the band scored a distribution deal for both Anchor Drops and Local Band Does OK, and for the first time, Umphrey's music was available in stores all over the country. Anchor Drops received rave reviews from several high-profile magazines. Umphrey's was booked to play the Bonnaroo Music Festival once again in June but unlike their 2002 performance, this time they would play a coveted late-night spot.

    "headlinerBio": "Umphrey's McGee is a progressive rock / jam band from South Bend, IN now based in Chicago, IL.\n\nThey are influenced musically by progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Dream Theater, and Genesis, as well as heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden. The band also identifies The Police, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences. However, there really isn't a style of popular music that Umphrey's does not cover. Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to Paul Simon.\n\nFormed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands. \n\nIn mid-1998, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as Divisions and All in Time.\n\nShortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.\n\nThe addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar). Another live album, One Fat Sucka, was released shortly after, containing live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.\n\nAround 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the \"Jimmy Stewart Ballroom\" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions \"Jimmy Stewart.\" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by \"McL\" in the \"Jimmy Stewart writeup\" on the fan message board known as \"The Bort\" at www.umphreaks.com.\n\n2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, Umphrey's was invited to play the first annual Bonnaroo Music Festival which took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people.

    "headlinerBio": "Cypress Hill is an American hip-hop group from South Gate, California. Cypress Hill was the first latino group to have platinum and multi-platinum albums and one of the first rap groups to gain a following with fans of hard rock and metal. The band was originally called DVX, but the name was changed after Mellow Man Ace left in 1988.\n\nTheir first album, which was self-titled, was released in August 1991. Its single was \"Phuncky Feel One\", but it was the B-side \"How I Could Just Kill A Man\" (formerly \"Trigga Happy Nigga\") that attracted more airplay on urban radio and college radio. Based on the success of the single and other tracks such as bilingual track \"Latin Lingo\" and X-rated Spanish track \"Tres Equis\", the album sold two million copies in the US alone. Subsequently, DJ Muggs produced the first House of Pain album, then worked on other projects like Funkdoobiest. The band made their first appearance at Lollapalooza on the side stage in 1992.\n\nBlack Sunday, the group's second album, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1993, recording the highest Soundscan for a rap group up until that time. Also with their debut still on the charts they became the first rap artists to have 2 albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 at the same time. With \"Insane in the Brain\" becoming a crossover hit, the album went triple platinum in the U.S. and sold about 3.25 million copies.\n\nCypress Hill was banned from Saturday Night Live after Muggs smoked cannabis on-air and the band trashed their instruments while playing their second single \"I Ain't Goin' Out Like That\". The band headlined the \"Soul Assassins\" tour with House of Pain and Funkdoobiest as support, then performed on a college tour with Rage Against the Machine and Seven Year Bitch. In 1993, Cypress Hill also had two tracks on the Judgment Night soundtrack, teamed up with Pearl Jam and Sonic Youth.\n\nThe band played at the 1994 Woodstock Festival introducing their new member Eric Bobo, formerly a percussionist with the Beastie Boys. Bobo is the son of salsa musician Willie Bobo. Rolling Stone magazine named the band as the best rap group in their music awards voted by critics and readers. Cypress Hill played at Lollapalooza for two successive years, topping the bill in 1995. They appeared on the The Simpsons episode \"Homerpalooza\".\n\nTheir third album Cypress Hill III: Temples of Boom was released in 1995 selling 1.5 million copies and reaching number 3 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the hit single \"Throw Your Set in the Air\". Cypress Hill also contributed a track \"I Wanna Get High\" to the High Times sponsored Hempilation album to support NORML.\n\n\nFeud With Ice Cube\n\nIce Cube asked to put \"Throw Your Set in the Air\" on his Friday soundtrack, but B-Real refused, prompting Cube to record a new song \"Friday\" with a similar chorus; Cypress Hill responded with the track \"No Rest For The Wicked.\" Westside Connection replied with the diss track \"King Of The Hill\" and \"Cross Em Out & Put a K\", to which Cypress Hill replied with \"Ice Cube Killa,\" which uses the same beat as \"King Of The Hill\" and disses Ice Cube and Mack 10. \"Ice Cube Killa\" has never been released officially. In 1997 B-Real of Cypress Hill and Ice Cube were invited to a late night talk show in order to reconcile their differences for the benefit of the hip hop community, and the feud thus ended. Cube And B-Real would work together later that year as guest features on the track \"Men of Steel\" for the soundtrack of Shaquille O'Neal's film Steel. B-Real and Cube did even feature as guests in Warren G's single \"Get U Down\" which also featured Snoop Dogg.\n\n\nContinued career\n\nSen Dog took a break from the band to form a Los Angeles based punk-rap band SX-10. Meanwhile in 1996, Cypress Hill appeared on the first 'Smokin' Grooves' tour, featuring Ziggy Marley, The Fugees, Busta Rhymes and A Tribe Called Quest. The band also released a nine track EP Unreleased and Revamped with rare mixes. In 1997, band members focused on their solo careers. Muggs released Muggs Presents ... the Soul Assassins featuring contributions from Wu-Tang Clan members, Dr. Dre, KRS-One, Wyclef Jean and Mobb Deep. B-Real appeared with Busta Rhymes, Coolio, LL Cool J and Method Man on \"Hit Em High\" from the multi-platinum Space Jam Soundtrack. He also appeared with RBX, Nas and KRS-One on \"East Coast Killer, West Coast Killer\" on Dr. Dre's Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath album, and released an album entitled \"The Psycho Realm\" from his side project of the same name. Though the focus that year was not on Cypress Hill, the band played Smokin' Grooves with George Clinton and Erykah Badu.\n\nCypress Hill released IV in 1998 which went gold in the U.S., even though the reviews were somewhat negative,[citation needed] on the backs of hit singles \"Tequila Sunrise\" and another tribute to smoking cannabis \"Dr. Greenthumb.\" Sen Dog also released the Get Wood sampler as part of SX-10 on the label Flip. In 1999, Cypress Hill helped with the PC crime/very mature video game Kingpin: Life of Crime. Three of their songs from the 1998 IV album were in the game ( \"16 Men Till There's No Men Left\", \"Checkmate\" and \"Lightning Strikes\"). B-Real also did some of the voices of the people in the game. Also in 1999, the band released a greatest-hits album in Spanish, Los grandes éxitos en español. Cypress Hill then fused genres with their two-disc release, Skull & Bones, in 2000. The first disc, \"Skull\" was comprised of rap tracks while \"Bones\" explored further the group's forays into rock. The album reached the Top 5 on the Billboard 200 and number 3 in Canada. The first single was \"Rock Superstar\" for rock radio and \"Rap Superstar\" for urban radio. The band also released Live at the Fillmore, a concert disc recorded at the Fillmore (in San Fransico) in 2000. Cypress Hill continued their experimentation with rock on the Stoned Raiders album in 2001. However, its sales were a disappointment, as the disc did not even reach the top 50 of the U.S. album charts. In 2001, the group appeared in the film How High.\n\nCypress Hill recorded \"Just Another Victim\" for the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as a theme song for Tazz. At the time, WWE was using original music for almost all of the wrestlers, so this was an unusual step for the company to take, but it remains one of the more memorable songs to emerge from the wrestling organization. The band released Till Death Do Us Part on March 23, 2004. The album saw the band experiment with reggae especially on the lead single \"What's Your Number\". The track features Tim Armstrong of Rancid on guitar and Rob Aston of The Transplants on backup vocals. It is based on the classic song \"Guns of Brixton\" on The Clash's London Calling and has proven to be a success on the modern rock charts. However, the album represented a further departure from the signature sound of their first four albums. The album also features appearances by Damian Marley, son of Bob Marley, Prodigy and Twin of Mobb Deep and producer the Alchemist.\n\nIn 2004, the song How I Could Just Kill A Man was included in the popular videogame Grand Theft Auto San Andreas created by Rockstar Games, playing on West Coast hip hop radio station Radio Los Santos. In December of 2005 a best of compilation album titled Greatest Hits From the Bong was released including 9 hits from previous albums and 2 new tracks. The group's next album was tentatively scheduled for an early 2007 release. In the summer of 2006, B-Real appeared on Snoop Dogg's single \"Vato\". Pharrell Williams produced the track, and originally sang the hook, but because of the video idea, B-Real was asked to sing the hook. Sen Dog is now currently touring with the Kottonmouth Kings, Kingspade and Dogboy on the Joint is on Fire Tour\n\nIn 2007 Cypress Hill toured with their full line up as a part of the Rock the Bells tour, held by Guerilla Union, and headlined with Public Enemy, Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, and a reunited Rage Against the Machine. Other acts included Immortal Technique, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, The Roots, EPMD, Pharoae Monch, Jedi Mind Tricks, Erykah Badu, MF Doom, Sage Francis, Brother Ali, The Coup, Blue Print, Lucky I Am, Living Legends, Felt, Cage, Mr. Lif, Grouch & Eligh, and Hangar 18.\n\n\nDeparture from Sony\n\nHaving fulfilled their contractual obligations with Sony Music, Cypress Hill will release an as-yet untitled album through a different record label in 2008.\nRecently, it was announced that Cypress Hill will be members of the Kannabis Kartel along with the Kottonmouth Kings and Potluck. Their album will be released on Suburban Noize Records.\n\n\nSTYLE\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nProduction\n\nOne of the band's most striking aspects is B-Real's exaggeratedly high-pitched nasal vocals, which fits and emphasizes the lyrics' concentration on parodied gangster stories.\n\nSen Dog's lyrics are progressively more violent and tend to involve fewer rhyme schemes compared with B-Real's. In addition, as the style is today, some words are emphasized by adding a background voice to say them, however, Sen Dog's emphases are always more prominent, mostly shouted alongside with the rapping.\n\nThe sound and groove of their music, produced by Muggs, is also notable for its influence and stoned aesthetic; with its bass-heavy rhythms and odd sample loops (\"Insane in the Brain\" is notable for having a horse neigh looped in its chorus), it carries a psychedelic value, which lessened in the later albums.\n\nThe band is also known for involving rock instruments in their songs. This has caused the band to sometimes be classified as a rapcore group. In IV, there is Lightning Strikes which doesn't truly use electric guitars, but a synthesized version of it. Skull & Bones has an entire disc using such instruments, labeled Bones. As for their later works, their involvement in rock ended with the album Stoned Raiders (the tracks Trouble (also the first single of the album), Amplified and Catastrophe being the songs).\n\nThe band's music is constantly subject to change; while the first album follows a more minimalistic and funky sound, Black Sunday, the successor, has a slightly darker side to it. III (Temples of Boom) and IV are mostly influenced by psychedelic music. The band abandoned that on Skull & Bones and got closer to the modern rap as it is today. Stoned Raiders has a more authentic sound than the rest, and Till Death Do Us Part carries reggae influences.\n\nThe band is also known to involve horns in their songs, and often have guitar and horns together in the instrumentals. What's Your Number?, Trouble, Tequila Sunrise, and (Rock) Superstar have become some of the bands most popular songs featuring these elements. Cypress Hill's experimenting in different genres of music even includes reggaeton in their track \"Latin Thugs\" which features Tego Calderon.\n\nSome fans feel that the band has drifted somewhat from the values of their earlier albums. For example in \"Strictly Hip Hop\" from Temples of Boom, the band complain about hip hop artists who have an album of hardcore tracks but have one or two pop songs which just so happen to be the singles. Cypress have arguably fallen into this trap with the single \"What's You Number?\"\n\nThe sound contribitions of DJ Muggs seems to be clearly influenced by marijuana consumption. Since one of the effects of a cannabis high is an altered audio sensual perception, the often slow paced and deep bass can be better appreciated. Furthermore, psychedelic sequences underly some parts of certain tracks such as \"I Wanna Get High\" for example. This is an interesting feature of their music, that had also been used before, especially during the 60's and 70's (e.g. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles).\n\n\nLyrics\n\nThe lyrics of tracks like \"How I Could Just Kill A Man\" offer an insight into the cultural expression of social stratification in L.A. at that point in history. Many other songs have cited topics such as police brutality, racial profiling, gang violence and anecdotes about invasion of privacy by police.\n\nFurthermore the celebration of marijuana consumption is what they are often associated with in songs like \"I Wanna Get High\", \"Stoned Is The Way Of The Walk\" or \"Hits From The Bong\", the themes of recreational use of marijuana are prevalent.\n\nMany of their songs also protest the current marijuana laws and voice their opinions on the hypocrisy of drug enforcement institutions.\n\nTheir lyrics often reflect the hip hop culture of Los Angeles in their earlier work such as their self-titled album and Black Sunday, which were very influential not only to Latino hip hop of the time but to many other hip hop groups around the world as well.\n\nThroughout their career they have commonly incorporated Spanish into their lyrics as well as slang used by some Latinos in Los Angeles on songs like \"Latin Lingo\". Their album \"Los Grandes Exitos En Espanol\" features Spanish translations of many of their hit songs.\n\nYears active 1987 -  present.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Andrew Bird (born July 11, 1973) is an American musician. He was born in Lake Bluff, Illinois and resides in the Chicago area. Bird is a singer, a violinist and, since 2004, a guitarist. He is also an accomplished whistler.\n\nHis early work, which echoed gypsy jazz and traditional folk, has led into his current sound, which mixes rock with more broad compositions. His years of solo song-craft have now enabled him to produce a sound that is uniquely his own.\n\nTrained by the Suzuki method from a young age and a graduate of Illinois' Northwestern University, Bird released his first solo album, Music of Hair, in  1996. Vastly different from his later releases, this first album showcases his violin skills and pays tribute to his fascination with both American and European folk traditions, as well as jazz and blues.\n\nHis initial commercial exposure was in collaborative work with the band Squirrel Nut Zippers. He was quickly lumped in with the swing craze that swept the United States music industry in the mid '90s; this is an affiliation that he is still working to shed.\n\nTaking on the role of band leader in 1997 with Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire, he released the album Thrills. This was followed by Oh! The Grandeur in 1998. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional folk, pre-war jazz and swing, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument.\n\nIn 2001, Bird released The Swimming Hour, his third release with the Bowl of Fire and a dramatic departure from previous recordings. The Swimming Hour featured a mixture of styles, from the zydeco-influenced \"Core and Rind\" to more straightforward rock songs. He has often referred to this record as his \"jukebox album\".\n\nThe Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded some time in 2003, having featured many skilled Chicago musicians including Kevin O'Donnell, Nora O'Connor, Andy Hopkins (aka Mr. Rudy Day), Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn and Ryan Hembrey.\n\nBird then released two subsequent solo albums, both distributed through the label operated by Ani DiFranco, Righteous Babe Records. The two records, 2003's Weather Systems and 2005's The Mysterious Production of Eggs, continue a progression towards an eclectic indie folk sound that has proven challenging to classify.\n\nBird's live solo shows have been notable in that he uses a multi-track system to sample and loop his own performance. For example, he may record a snippet of his performance on violin, then play a \"loop\" of that sound. This provides a more full-bodied sound and aurally suggests a band performance, rather than the sound of a solo artist.\n\nBird's next full-length album Armchair Apocrypha (Fat Possum) was released on March 20th 2007.\n\nNovember 2007 saw the Soldier On EP originally a European tour-only release. But due to high demand and unanticipated critical acclaim was released digitally and in CD-format on both sides of the Atlantic. Critics and fans alike have hearkened to the EP's first track, \"The Trees Were Mistaken\", a complex yet austere looping composition that marks a departure from Bird's earlier body of work. It also contains a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Oh Sister\".\n\nJanuary 2009 saw Noble Beast, also available with instrumental album Useless Creatures, released worldwide to positive reviews.\n\nThe Fatal Shore Songfacts reports that Break it Yourself, Bird's sixth solo studio album, was released on March 6, 2012 through Mom+Pop records in the US and Bella Union in the UK. The origins of the LP lie in a couple of jam sessions by a gathering of Bird's friends in the singer's western Illinois barn, near the banks of the Mississippi River.\n\nOf his 2019 album My Finest Work Yet, Talia Schlanger of NPR says \"Bird zooms way out on humanity across history's timeline, seeking insight about our current age, in a way he hopes 'stays above the news feed noise.'\"  Many tracks, including the opener \"Sisyphus,\" include Andrew's trademark whistling. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Bird\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Goo Goo Dolls is an alternative rock band formed in 1985 in Buffalo, New York, USA by guitarist/vocalist John Rzeznik and bassist/vocalist Robby Takac initially under the name the Sex Maggots (the new name was chosen from an ad in True Detective magazine at the behest of a local club owner). They are most famous for the hit \"Iris\", featured on the soundtrack to the 1998 film City of Angels. Currently, the band consists of John Rzeznik (guitar, vocals) and Robby Takac (vocals, bass).\n\nEarly in their career, the Goo Goo Dolls were frequently dismissed by critics as mere imitators of The Replacements; however, the band refined its sound to be more mainstream, which helped it become one of the most popular adult alternative rock bands of the latter half of the '90s, selling millions of records to audiences largely unfamiliar with their inspirations. That's no bitch on the band, either -- their music simply improved in craft and accessibility as the years progressed, and radio happened to be receptive to what a decade earlier would have been considered collegiate power pop. Thus, the band landed two huge hits with the acoustic ballads \"Name\" and \"Iris.\"\n\nOriginally a cover band with a taste for power pop and classic rock & roll, the group soon began writing its own songs. Their early sound recalled the The Replacements' origins as a bratty punk band (circa Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash) -- melodic, snotty, and a little bit thrashy. That sound was the reason the band attracted the interest of the heavy metal label Metal Blade, which issued their debut album in 1987 (known either as The Goo Goo girls or First Release). 1989's Jed continued in a similar vein; the college radio breakthrough came with 1990's Hold Me Up, a Replacements-ish power pop record.\n\n1993's Superstar Car Wash was the Goo Goo Dolls' artistic breakthrough; though it did nothing to quell the Replacements comparisons, it was a finely crafted pop/rock record, and its lead single, \"We Are the Normal,\" was co-written with Replacements leader Paul Westerberg himself. Still, Superstar Car Wash wasn't the commercial force the band hoped it would be, especially in light of the success of similar bands like the Gin Blossoms. That all changed with 1995's A Boy Named Goo, when an L.A. rock station put the acoustic-driven ballad \"Name\" into heavy rotation. It was eventually released as a single nationwide, and went Top Five late in the year; platinum sales for the album followed close behind. Unfortunately, the original drummer was no longer around to enjoy the band's success; prior to the album's release, he'd been sacked and replaced by drummer Mike Malinin.\n\nDissatisfied with the royalty rates in their Metal Blade contract, the band waged a legal battle that wound up allowing them to jump to parent company Warner Brothers. Somewhat drained, Rzeznik and the band shook off a case of writer's block to contribute the ballad \"Iris\" to the soundtrack of the 1998 americanized version of City of Angels (Featuring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan). Appearing that April, the song was a monster smash, although it was never released as a single (so its official Top Ten pop chart status doesn't convey how popular it was); for a better indicator, \"Iris\" spent nearly a year on Billboard's airplay charts, including an astonishing 18 weeks at number one, and was nominated for three Grammys. The band's next album, Dizzy Up the Girl, was released in September, during the middle of \"Iris\"'s marathon airplay run, and sold over three million copies. Its clean, polished sound completed the Goo Goo Dolls' transformation into mainstream pop/rockers who happened to have alternative roots. Further hits from the record followed over the next year, including \"Slide,\" \"Dizzy,\" and the Grammy-nominated \"Black Balloon,\" and the band toured heavily in support. The Goo Goo Dolls revamped their sound for 2001's career retrospective, Ego, Opinion, Art & Commerce. A year later, the trio hit the charts with \"Here Is Gone\" from their seventh studio album, Gutterflower. The CD/DVD combo Live in Buffalo: July 4, 2004 helped fans endure the long wait for the band's next studio album, Let Love In, which didn't appear until 2006. The band toured through the summer of 2007. The band released the first of two greatest hits compilation, entitled Greatest Hits Volume One: The Singles, November 13th 2007. \n\nIn February 2008, the band officially headed into studio to work on their new record.\nIn August 2010, the band released their newest album, Something for the Rest of Us.\n\nSingles:\nThere You Are (Hold Me Up)\nJust the Way You Are (Hold Me Up)\nI'm Awake Now (Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Soundtrack)\nWe Are the Normal (Superstar Car Wash)\nFallin' Down (Superstar Car Wash)\nOnly One (A Boy Named Goo)\nFlat Top (A Boy Named Goo)\nName (A Boy Named Goo)\nLong Way Down (A Boy Named Goo)\nNaked (A Boy Named Goo)\nLazy Eye (Batman & Robin Soundtrack)\nIris (City of Angels Soundtrack/Dizzy Up the Girl)\nSlide (Dizzy Up the Girl)\nBlack Balloon (Dizzy Up the Girl)\nDizzy (Dizzy Up the Girl)\nBroadway (Dizzy Up the Girl)\nHere Is Gone (Gutterflower)\nBig Machine (Gutterflower)\nSympathy (Gutterflower)\nGive A Little Bit (Live in Buffalo: July 4, 2004/Let Love In)\nBetter Days (Target's Sounds of the Season/Let Love In)\nStay With You (Let Love In)\nLet Love In (Let Love In)\nBefore It's Too Late (Sam & Mikaela's Theme) (Transformers Soundtrack)\nHome (Something for the Rest of Us)\nReal (AT&T Team USA Soundtrack)\nNot Broken (Something For The Rest Of Us) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Goo+Goo+Dolls\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Brandi Carlile (b. June 1, 1981, in Ravensdale, Washington) is an American singer-songwriter, perhaps best known for her 2007 single \"The Story\". Carlile's music has been categorized in several genres, including pop, rock, alternative country, and folk. She released her first album, 'Brandi Carlile', on July 12, 2005.\n\nIn the beginning, Columbia Records signed Carlile in late 2004 on the strength of songs she'd been recording periodically at home. Released in 2005, Brandi Carlile showcased those early songs along with several newly recorded tracks. Shortly after the release of Brandi Carlile, she left her home in Seattle and set out with the Hanseroth brothers, with whom she'd worked on her earliest recordings and independent regional tours. The tightly knit trio, which forms the core of her band today, spent the better part of two years on the road honing the songs that would later become part of her album \"The Story\".\n\nIn 2005, she was featured on Rolling Stone's \"10 Artists to Watch in 2005\" list. By the end of 2006, Carlile had embarked on several headlining tours and supported a variety of artists including Ray LaMontagne, The Fray, Chris Isaak, Tori Amos, and Shawn Colvin.\n\nHer second album, The Story, was released in April 2007. It was produced by T Bone Burnett and includes a collaboration with the Indigo Girls on \"Cannonball.\" The album was recorded in an eleven-day-long session with Carlile , the twins (Tim and Phil Hanseroth) and drummer Matt Chamberlain to capture the raw intensity of Carlile's live performances. The crack in Carlile's vocals during the title track, \"The Story\", came out by accident and was a direct result of the way the album was recorded. Carlile herself describes the vocals as \"technically wrong but emotionally right.\"\n\nCarlile was exposed to a wider audience when ABC's Grey's Anatomy showcased three of her songs: \"Tragedy,\" \"What Can I Say,\" and \"Throw It All Away\". In April 2007, Grey's Anatomy debuted a version of the video for the single The Story interspersed with footage from the show. On May 3, 2007, a special two-hour episode of \"Grey's Anatomy\" featured Carlile's song \"Turpentine\" during footage of the \"Grey's Anatomy\" spin-off, \"Private Practice\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Jackson Stell, known by his stage name of Big Wild, is an electronic DJ, producer, composer, and engineer. \n\nStell was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts. When he was only 14, Stell started making hip-hop influenced beats under the name \"JBeats\". However, it wasn't until his girlfriend took him to Big Sur California in 2012 that he began making music under the name Big Wild. Stell said in an interview with 303 Magazine, \"I never really had witnessed a landscape like that before being from Massachusetts. It made me want to do a music project where I could be adventurous, unique and big with my sound.\" Once under the name Big Wild, Stell began producing distinctively atmospheric, groove-oriented tracks.\n\nIn 2015, through Stell's Soundcloud, the Seattle-based electronic music duo ODESZA, had been exposed to his music and enjoyed it. ODESZA asked Stell to open for them at the San Francisco and LA stops of their tour, and Stell eventually joined them on their whole tour after he finished and released his remix of ODESZA's track \"Say My Name.\"\n\nIn 2016, Big Wild's track \"Aftergold\", featuring Tove Styrke, amassed millions of plays on many networks, such as Soundcloud and Youtube, and Stell started touring with other DJs and producers including GRiZ, Tycho, Pretty Lights, and Bassnectar.\n\nBig Wild's first EP, The Invincible EP, was released in early 2017 on ODESZA's Foreign Family Collective label, and included the single \"I Just Wanna\" plus features for Yuna and iDA HAWK. Big Wild released his debut album, Superdream, on February 1st, 2019 on all major platforms.\n\nStell set out on his own tour in spring 2017, hitting 27 dates around America.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Wild\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Goo Goo Dolls is an alternative rock band formed in 1985 in Buffalo, New York, USA by guitarist/vocalist John Rzeznik and bassist/vocalist Robby Takac initially under the name the Sex Maggots (the new name was chosen from an ad in True Detective magazine at the behest of a local club owner). They are most famous for the hit \"Iris\", featured on the soundtrack to the 1998 film City of Angels. Currently, the band consists of John Rzeznik (guitar, vocals) and Robby Takac (vocals, bass).\n\nEarly in their career, the Goo Goo Dolls were frequently dismissed by critics as mere imitators of The Replacements; however, the band refined its sound to be more mainstream, which helped it become one of the most popular adult alternative rock bands of the latter half of the '90s, selling millions of records to audiences largely unfamiliar with their inspirations. That's no bitch on the band, either -- their music simply improved in craft and accessibility as the years progressed, and radio happened to be receptive to what a decade earlier would have been considered collegiate power pop. Thus, the band landed two huge hits with the acoustic ballads \"Name\" and \"Iris.\"\n\nOriginally a cover band with a taste for power pop and classic rock & roll, the group soon began writing its own songs. Their early sound recalled the The Replacements' origins as a bratty punk band (circa Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash) -- melodic, snotty, and a little bit thrashy. That sound was the reason the band attracted the interest of the heavy metal label Metal Blade, which issued their debut album in 1987 (known either as The Goo Goo girls or First Release). 1989's Jed continued in a similar vein; the college radio breakthrough came with 1990's Hold Me Up, a Replacements-ish power pop record.\n\n1993's Superstar Car Wash was the Goo Goo Dolls' artistic breakthrough; though it did nothing to quell the Replacements comparisons, it was a finely crafted pop/rock record, and its lead single, \"We Are the Normal,\" was co-written with Replacements leader Paul Westerberg himself. Still, Superstar Car Wash wasn't the commercial force the band hoped it would be, especially in light of the success of similar bands like the Gin Blossoms. That all changed with 1995's A Boy Named Goo, when an L.A. rock station put the acoustic-driven ballad \"Name\" into heavy rotation. It was eventually released as a single nationwide, and went Top Five late in the year; platinum sales for the album followed close behind. Unfortunately, the original drummer was no longer around to enjoy the band's success; prior to the album's release, he'd been sacked and replaced by drummer Mike Malinin.\n\nDissatisfied with the royalty rates in their Metal Blade contract, the band waged a legal battle that wound up allowing them to jump to parent company Warner Brothers. Somewhat drained, Rzeznik and the band shook off a case of writer's block to contribute the ballad \"Iris\" to the soundtrack of the 1998 americanized version of City of Angels (Featuring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan). Appearing that April, the song was a monster smash, although it was never released as a single (so its official Top Ten pop chart status doesn't convey how popular it was); for a better indicator, \"Iris\" spent nearly a year on Billboard's airplay charts, including an astonishing 18 weeks at number one, and was nominated for three Grammys. The band's next album, Dizzy Up the Girl, was released in September, during the middle of \"Iris\"'s marathon airplay run, and sold over three million copies. Its clean, polished sound completed the Goo Goo Dolls' transformation into mainstream pop/rockers who happened to have alternative roots. Further hits from the record followed over the next year, including \"Slide,\" \"Dizzy,\" and the Grammy-nominated \"Black Balloon,\" and the band toured heavily in support. The Goo Goo Dolls revamped their sound for 2001's career retrospective, Ego, Opinion, Art & Commerce. A year later, the trio hit the charts with \"Here Is Gone\" from their seventh studio album, Gutterflower. The CD/DVD combo Live in Buffalo: July 4, 2004 helped fans endure the long wait for the band's next studio album, Let Love In, which didn't appear until 2006. The band toured through the summer of 2007. The band released the first of two greatest hits compilation, entitled Greatest Hits Volume One: The Singles, November 13th 2007. \n\nIn February 2008, the band officially headed into studio to work on their new record.\nIn August 2010, the band released their newest album, Something for the Rest of Us.\n\nSingles:\nThere You Are (Hold Me Up)\nJust the Way You Are (Hold Me Up)\nI'm Awake Now (Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Soundtrack)\nWe Are the Normal (Superstar Car Wash)\nFallin' Down (Superstar Car Wash)\nOnly One (A Boy Named Goo)\nFlat Top (A Boy Named Goo)\nName (A Boy Named Goo)\nLong Way Down (A Boy Named Goo)\nNaked (A Boy Named Goo)\nLazy Eye (Batman & Robin Soundtrack)\nIris (City of Angels Soundtrack/Dizzy Up the Girl)\nSlide (Dizzy Up the Girl)\nBlack Balloon (Dizzy Up the Girl)\nDizzy (Dizzy Up the Girl)\nBroadway (Dizzy Up the Girl)\nHere Is Gone (Gutterflower)\nBig Machine (Gutterflower)\nSympathy (Gutterflower)\nGive A Little Bit (Live in Buffalo: July 4, 2004/Let Love In)\nBetter Days (Target's Sounds of the Season/Let Love In)\nStay With You (Let Love In)\nLet Love In (Let Love In)\nBefore It's Too Late (Sam & Mikaela's Theme) (Transformers Soundtrack)\nHome (Something for the Rest of Us)\nReal (AT&T Team USA Soundtrack)\nNot Broken (Something For The Rest Of Us) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Goo+Goo+Dolls\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The 400 Unit is Derry deBorja (keyboards), Jimbo Hart (bass) and Browan Lollar (guitar). Matt Pence (Centro-matic/South San Gabriel) lends his talents as co-producer, drummer and engineer. \n\nThe album, which was released in 2009, was co-produced by Isbell and The 400 Unit with Matt Pence. “I want it to be known that it’s a band record,” says Isbell. “I want it to be known that it’s something we all did together. Even though I wrote the songs, it was a very inclusive project.” Isbell has posted the new track, “Seven-Mile Island,” on the band’s MySpace site. \n\nThe album was recorded at the renowned FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, AL. Isbell, who Details Magazine calls “one of America’s best young songwriters,” is following in the tradition of American songwriters who have recorded in North Alabama. Much like Arthur Alexander, Eddie Hinton and Spooner Oldham, Isbell mixes a soulful vocal style with songs that are passionate and unrepentant in their sense of place and direct in their stubborn Southerness.\n\nIsbell is known for his songwriting, in particular his storytelling about common folks from the South and their perspectives on life. Whether it's a song about a marriage on the rocks because of a soldier's PTSD in \"Soldiers Get Strange\" or a narrator relating his inner thoughts as a bar closes in \"Streetlights,\" Isbell provides the inner lives of characters that connect to listeners because of his honest and sometimes darkly humorous lyrics.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Isbell+and+The+400+Unit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band features Steve Miller on guitar and lead vocals, and is known for a string of (mainly) mid-1970s hit singles that continue to be staples of the classic rock radio format.\n\nSteve Miller (born 5 October 1943) is a blues and rock and roll guitarist and performer. He was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin but attended high school in Dallas. While at St. Mark's School of Texas, he formed his first band, The Marksmen. Miller taught one of his classmates, Royce Boz Scaggs, a few guitar chords so that he could join the band; Scaggs became better known by his nickname, Boz. Miller attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison during the 1960s, where he formed The Ardells. Scaggs joined the Ardells the next year. Ben Sidran was added to the Ardells as a keyboardist the following year.\n\nIn 1968, Miller formed the Steve Miller Band, with Scaggs handling vocals, and released an album, Children of the Future, the first in a series of discs rooted solidly in the psychedelic blues style that dominated the San Francisco music scene at the time. Scaggs would leave the band after a couple of albums with vocal chores taken over by drummer Tim Davis; Miller himself would begin singing occasional lead on 1969's Brave New World. These albums performed respectably on the album charts but failed to yield a hit.\n\nIn the 1970's the band had some hits that became classics over the years - Jet Airliner, with some evocative lyrics that brought home the loss of life on the road; and The Joker which includes the famous line about the \"pompatus of love\", which is of course nonsense, but that didn't stop a lot of stoned folks from spending years talking amongst themselves.\n\nSteve Miller's father was a wealthy doctor in Dallas, and friends with famous guitarist and guitar designer Les Paul.  Les Paul gave Miller his first guitar lessons.\n\nLongtime member Norton Buffalo (harmonica player) died from lung cancer on October 30, 2009.\n\nJohn King (drummer during \"The Joker\" era) died after a short bout of kidney cancer on October 26, 2010.\n\nBand-member James Cooke died from cancer on 16 May 2011. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Miller+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Joe Bonamassa (born May 8, 1977) is an American blues rock guitarist, singer and songwriter.\n\nBonamassa was born in Utica, New York. He started playing guitar at age four, encouraged by his father, who was an avid music fan and exposed him to British blues rock records by Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck, greatly inspiring him. At 11 years old Joe was mentored and trained by American guitar legend, Danny Gatton. When he was 12 years old, he had his own band called Smokin' Joe Bonamassa, which gigged around western New York and Pennsylvania, including cities such as Scranton and Buffalo, but only on weekends since Joe had school on weekdays.

    "headlinerBio": "Lucinda Williams (born January 26, 1953) is an American rock, folk, and alt-country songwriter and singer. A three-time Grammy Award winner, she was named \"America's best songwriter\" by TIME magazine in 2002.\n\nWilliams has garnered considerable critical acclaim but her commercial success has been moderate. She has a reputation as a perfectionist and as a slow worker when it comes to recording; six years passed between the release of her second and third albums.  However, she frequently makes guest appearances on other artists' albums and contributes to compilations and soundtracks. She has recorded with Elvis Costello, Nanci Griffith, John Prine, Leftover Salmon, and Steve Earle, among others.  She has also opened concerts for artists such as Neil Young.\n\nEarly life\n\nWilliams was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, the daughter of poet and literature professor Miller Williams. Her father worked as a visiting professor in Mexico and Chile as well as different parts of the American South, before settling at the University of Arkansas. His daughter showed an affinity for music at an early age, and was playing guitar at 12.\n\nCareer\n\nBy her early 20s, Williams was playing publicly in Austin, Texas and Houston, Texas, concentrating on a folk-rock-country blend. She moved to Jackson, Mississippi, in 1978 to record her first album, for Smithsonian/Folkways Records. Titled Ramblin', it was a collection of country and blues covers. She followed it up in 1980 with Happy Woman Blues, which consisted of her own material. Neither album received much attention.\n\nIn the 1980s Williams moved to Los Angeles, California (before finally settling in Nashville, TN), where -- performing both backed by a rock band and in acoustic settings -- she developed a following and a critical reputation. Nevertheless, it was not until 1988 that Rough Trade Records released the self-titled Lucinda Williams. The single \"Changed the Locks\", about a broken relationship, received radio play around the country and gained fans among music insiders, including Tom Petty, who would later cover the song.\n\nIts follow-up, Sweet Old World (Chameleon, 1992), was a melancholy album dealing with themes of suicide and death. Williams's biggest success during the early '90s was as a songwriter. Mary Chapin Carpenter recorded a cover of \"Passionate Kisses\" (from Lucinda Williams) in 1992, and the song became a smash country hit for which Williams received the Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1994.\n\nWilliams had garnered considerable critical acclaim, but her commercial success was moderate. Emmylou Harris said of Williams, \"She is an example of the best of what country at least says it is. But, for some reason, she's completely out of the loop. And I feel strongly that that's country music's loss.\"\n\nWilliams also gained a reputation as a perfectionist and slow worker when it came to recording; six years would pass before her next album release, though she appeared as a guest on other artists' albums and contributed to several tribute compilations during this period.\n\nThe long-awaited release, 1998's Car Wheels on a Gravel Road was Williams' breakthrough to the mainstream. Containing the single \"Still I Long for Your Kiss\" from the Robert Redford film The Horse Whisperer, the album received wide critical notice and soon went gold. It received a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. She toured with Bob Dylan and on her own in support of the album.\n\nWilliams followed up the success of Car Wheels with Essence (2001). This release featured a less produced, more stripped-down approach both musically and lyrically, and moved Williams further from the country music establishment while winning fans in the alternative music world. She won the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Female Rock performance for the single \"Get Right With God\", an atypically uptempo gospel-rock tune from the otherwise rather low-key release. The title track was co-written and co-recorded with alternative country musician Ryan Adams.\n\nHer seventh album, World Without Tears, was released in 2003. A musically adventurous though lyrically downbeat album, this release found Williams experimenting with talking blues stylings and electric blues.\n\nIn 2006, Lucinda recorded a version of the John Hartford classic \"Gentle On My Mind,\" which played over the closing credits of the Will Ferrell filmTalladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby\n\nWilliams was a guest vocalist on the song \"Factory Girls\" from Irish punk-folk band Flogging Molly's 2004 album, \"Within a Mile of Home\", and appeared on Elvis Costello's The Delivery Man. She duetted with Steve Earle on the song \"You're Still Standin' There\" from his album I Feel Alright from 1996.\n\nWilliams released the album \"West\" on February 13, 2007, to mostly good reviews. The material is highly personal, chronicling the death of her mother and the breakup of a turbulent relationship.\n\nLucinda released her ninth studio album, \"Little Honey\", on October 14th.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lucinda+Williams\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Damien Jurado (born 12 November 1972) is an American singer-songwriter in the indie-rock tradition of Seattle, Washington. His music is regarded as being heavily influenced by folk music. Over the years he has released albums on many labels; today his primary label is Secretly Canadian. He was once in the band, Coolidge, with Seattle's David Bazan.\n\nJurado's solo career began during the mid-1990s, releasing lo-fi folk based recordings on his own cassette-only label, Casa Recordings, beginning in 1995. \n\nJurado often makes use of found-sound and field-recording techniques, and has experimented with different forms of tape recordings. In 2000 he released Postcards and Audio Letters, a collection of found audio letters and fragments that he had found from sources such as thrift store tape players and answering machines. Also released in 2000 was Ghost of David,, Jurado's bleakest and most personal sounding record to date. I Break Chairs, (2002) was produced by long time friend,  David Bazan. It was his last album for Sub Pop, and was a much rockier, electric affair. After signing for the Indiana-based label Secretly Canadian, Damien Jurado reverted to his trademark folk ballad-based style, releasing six more albums: Where Shall You Take Me? (2003), On My Way To Absence (2005), And Now That I'm In Your Shadow (2006), Caught in the Trees (2008), Saint Bartlett (2010) and Maraqopa (2012).\n\nOfficial blog: iamcaughtinthetrees.blogspot.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "While it’s a rare commodity for a band to tour as consistently as Slightly Stoopid, the group’s diligent commitment to live music provides some insight into their loyal fan base and unique creative metamorphosis throughout their 17-year existence. Though it's been a couple of years since the release of their last studio album, Top Of The World (August 14, 2012), the Ocean Beach, California-based group—led by co-founders and multi-instrumentalists Kyle McDonald and Miles Doughty—have also found the same passionate dedication to their studio craft, holing up between tours in their own San Diego recording studio and record label complex. The balance of a prolific touring regimen between albums have helped to refine the tasty fusion and massive groove that permeates Stoopid’s trademark sound and seven album catalogue, as well as their live shows.\n\n\"We're a touring act, and we've been on the road pretty much non-stop over the last decade,\" explains Doughty, offering that the more recent creation of the band's own local recording studio and rehearsal clubhouse (within the warehouse district of Mission Valley just inland of Ocean Beach) certainly aided and influenced their last release Top of the World, and has inspired their latest sessions, which the band anticipates could stretch into a few different recording projects.\n\n\"Over the last 3 years we started our own studio and within the last 9 months, anticipating the window for new album sessions, the band has invested into innovations and equipment upgrades for the studio in a quest to capture and progress our signature sound forward. Having our own studio really enables us to make records at our own pace and to make the right records, hopefully (with a grin) at various stages of our career,” Doughty continues. “What's nice about having our own environment to record in and analyze the music is it really lets you keep an organic feel. For us, I feel like it's a step into the next level, as far as understanding the process of recording, understanding the process of songwriting. We took everything that we've learned over the years and really put it into this place and into our music.” The property also houses the creative loft space that has become the official offices of the band’s own label Stoopid Records, which issued the band’s second album in 1999 Acoustic Roots, and has continued to be their preferred method of distributing the band’s recorded material.\n\nAnother key ingredient to what makes Slightly Stoopid extraordinarily special is the inclusion of several musical guests, both live and in the studio. \"It really keeps that 'family atmosphere' for us,” says Doughty. “I think it really shows in the music — we live for the spirit of collaboration and on Top of The World we had G. Love, Angelo Moore from Fishbone, Don Carlos, Barrington Levy, Ian Neville from Dumpstaphunk, Tory Ruffin from Morris Day and the Time and Fishbone, and singer/songwriter Angela Hunte. Angelo Moore to me is one of the greatest front-men to ever step foot on a stage. As a fan and out of respect, I try to do something with Angelo every time we have a record, really. If you listen to his lyrics, his vocal performance—I don't know who could keep up with Angelo on stage. Don Carlos from Black Uhuru is one of the legendary reggae singers of all time and we've had the pleasure of working with him the last few years. We've been friends with G. Love for over 15 years, and we've been able to work together quite a few different times in the studio. It seems like second nature. Whenever you're recording with G., it's almost like you're really just hanging out with your bro and you happen to hit record. We've done so many shows together and so many studio sessions, it becomes second nature.“ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Slightly+Stoopid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band also identifies The Police, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences. However, there really isn't a style of popular music that Umphrey's does not cover. Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to Paul Simon.\n\nFormed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands. \n\nIn mid-1998, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as Divisions and All in Time.\n\nShortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.\n\nThe addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar). Another live album, One Fat Sucka, was released shortly after, containing live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.\n\nAround 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the \"Jimmy Stewart Ballroom\" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions \"Jimmy Stewart.\" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by \"McL\" in the \"Jimmy Stewart writeup\" on the fan message board known as \"The Bort\" at www.umphreaks.com.\n\n2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK.

    "headlinerBio": " NEEDTOBREATHE is an American Christian rock band from Seneca, South Carolina. They were formed in 1998.\n\n“We wanted to make an important record in the way that people used to make records. Bands rarely have the time that allows them to create a game-changing album like Born to Run, Rumours, or Damn The Torpedoes. So we said, ‘Let's set ourselves up to do that. Let's believe in the songs enough that we're willing to take the time they need and really push ourselves. It may sound naïve, but we still have a dream that we're going to make a record that's going to change everything for us.”\n\nWhen NEEDTOBREATHE’s Bear and Bo Rinehart set out to write the songs that appear on the band’s new album, The Reckoning, they felt something bigger awaited them. It wasn’t just commercial success either. The band’s last album The Outsiders hit No. 9 on Billboard’s Rock Albums chart, went Top 20 on the Top 200, saw the band sell out venues such as Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium and Chicago’s House of Blues, and score an impressive number of placements in blockbuster films and numerous prime time television-shows. Bear explains “There was always this creeping reminder that we needed to show what the last ten years on the road had taught us. If we couldn't do that, everything we had worked for was meaningless.”\n\nWith their reputation as a must-see live act built from non-stop touring, the Rinehart brothers, pastor’s sons who hail from the rural South Carolina town of Possum Kingdom, along with drummer Joe Stillwell and bass player Seth Bolt, were determined to create a statement-making album that truly captured the magic behind this genuinely appealing rock band.\n\n“We considered every note, every sound, and every lyric that went on this album,” Bo says of their fourth album The Reckoning, which was co-produced by the band with Rick Beato (who worked with the band on their records The Heat and The Outsiders), and was recorded over seven months mostly at their Plantation Studios in Charleston, SC. “Everything was put through the ‘Do we really believe in this or not,’ filter. We never settled. We were looking for a spark. Sometimes in the studio you’ve got to keep searching until something happens that feels magical. We were waiting for that moment to strike on each song before we called this album finished.” Bear adds, “At one point, we had done 10 different versions of the same song, but that process is what the record came to be about. We felt like no one could take this moment from us. I think you can feel the pressure we put on ourselves in every note of this record. The songs and the album became something much bigger than us ... something we had to live up to.”\n\nLyrically, all roads lead from the album’s title, which Bear says has several different meanings, one of them being the justification of accounts. “I like the idea that you put in all this work and at some point it comes to a peak -- that’s the reckoning time.”\n\nWhat the band emerged with is a timeless-sounding album rooted in classic American rock and roll, unafraid to veer off into unexpected directions. Songs such as “Maybe They’re On To Us” address the paranoia of wondering whether people know too much about the band. “It also asks, ‘Are we still driven in the same way?’ We’re always questioning ourselves,” Bear says. Even the songs that may sound light-hearted on the surface, like “White Fences,” “Slumber,” and “Drive All Night,” explore serious themes. “’White Fences’ is about the American dream of growing up in a big house with a white picket fence, but when the dream is broken and things don’t pan out the way you planned, asking who’s going to fix it,” Bo says. “’Slumber’ is meant to be about how beauty is all around you but you just can’t see it because of the funk you’re in,” Bear says. “It speaks to something that we really care about which is giving yourself a chance.” And there’s “Drive All Night,” a galloping barnstormer that Bear sees as a statement on the false idea that one can run away from one’s problems. “The truth is, the more you run away, the worse it gets, whereas if you embrace the things around you, the more joy you’re going to have,” he says.\n\nWith their intriguing melodies and bright choruses, the songs on The Reckoning are certain to translate in the live setting, something that is crucial to the band. “The worst thing that could happen is you get done playing and people don’t think about you again. We’ll do whatever it takes to force people to make a decision about our band, whether they love us or not. It makes for more passionate fans.”\n\n“We've always bought into the fact that anything worth having is going to cost you a lot, so I think we were prepared to lose everything. The Reckoning is our investigation into everything we believed to be true and a justification for everything we still do.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/NEEDTOBREATHE\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "\nDeath Cab for Cutie is an American indie rock band formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1997. The band consists of Ben Gibbard (vocals, guitar, piano), Nicholas Harmer (bass), Jason McGerr (drums), Dave Depper (guitar) and Zac Rae (keyboards).\n\nDeath Cab began as a solo project of Ben Gibbard, now the band's vocalist and guitarist. Gibbard took the band name from the satirical song Death Cab for Cutie, performed by The Bonzo Dog Band in The Beatles' 1967 experimental film Magical Mystery Tour. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords; the release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the band into a complete project. He recruited Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as an electric guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass guitarist, and Nathan Good to play drums. \n\nThe four released the LP Something About Airplanes on August 18th 1998. The album was favorably reviewed in the independent music scene, and in 2000 the band released We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes. Nathan Good left the band at some point during this album's production. His playing on “The Employment Pages” and “Company Calls Epilogue” were kept, but Gibbard played drums on all other songs.\n\nMichael Schorr would first appear on The Forbidden Love E.P., released on October 24, 2000. In 2001, another LP was released, entitled The Photo Album. Limited editions of this album contained three bonus tracks, which were later released separately as The Stability EP.\n\nIn 2003, there was another change of drummer, with Jason McGerr of Eureka Farm replacing Schorr. McGerr would play drums on the next release, Transatlanticism.\n\nTransatlanticism was released in October of 2003. It received critical praise and also became the band's top-selling album, with 225,000 copies sold during its first year out.\n\nIn spring of 2004, the band recorded a live E.P. titled The John Byrd E.P., named for their sound engineer. The E.P. was released on Barsuk Records in March 2004.\n\nIn November of 2004, Death Cab for Cutie signed a “long-term worldwide deal” with Atlantic Records, leaving their long-time label Barsuk Records. Gibbard stated on the official website www.deathcabforcutie.com that nothing would change except that “Next to the picture of Barsuk holding a 7\", there will be the letter \"A\" on both the spine and back of our upcoming albums.” This was a marked change from Gibbard's earlier views on major-label relations, which he said “are set up to fuck you and take all your money.”. After signing to Atlantic, the band was still nervous about corporate economics, and encouraged fans to download its songs from the Internet.\n\nThe first and second singles off the band's Atlantic Record release Plans were “Soul Meets Body” and “Crooked Teeth”, respectively. The full album was released in August of 2005. Plans was somewhat well-acclaimed by critics and fans, and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album of 2005. It achieved Gold Status in 2006 after charting on Billboard for 47 consecutive weeks.\n\nThe band released a touring DVD titled Drive Well, Sleep Carefully in 2005. Known for their contributions to animal rights, the band is supporting the activist group PETA in giving away copies of the DVD to promote animal rights.\n\nIn early 2006, the band announced the upcoming release of Directions, eleven short films inspired by songs from the Plans album, each directed by a different person. The videos were posted one at a time at the band's website and the DVD went on sale April 11, 2006.\n\nOn May 12, 2008 their album, Narrow Stairs, was released  and was well received by both critics and fans. It was their first album to reach #1 on the Billboard 200. The album contains the singles \"I Will Possess Your Heart\", \"Cath...\" and \"Grapevine Fires\".\n\nThe band's latest released The Open Door EP, which was released on March 31, 2009. Their main styles consist of slow progressive rock with dark lyrics.\n\nThe band's seventh album, Codes and Keys, was released on May 31, 2011. The album's first single was \"You Are A Tourist\".\n\nOn October 11, 2013, the band reportedly began working on their eighth studio album. This was then confirmed by the group's official Instagram profile in which an image was uploaded with the caption \"DCFC LP8 begins\". The new album will be produced by Rich Costey and is expected to be released in early 2015. In an interview with Stereogum, Gibbard said of the new album, \"I do think from start to finish it's a much better record than Codes And Keys. If that record turned anybody off, I feel pretty strongly that this one could win them back. There are threads in this one that connect back to our earliest stuff that people love.\" On October 29, 2013, the band released a remastered tenth-anniversary version of their 2003 album Transatlanticism. The new album included a vinyl LP and MP3 download, with demos for all the songs from the album.\n\nAs part of the 2014 Record Store Day, the band released its first live album, a vinyl-only double LP recorded during various 2012 tour dates with Magik*Magik Orchestra. Included within the packaging was a code for a digital download of the recording.\n\nOn August 13, 2014, after 17 years as a member of Death Cab for Cutie, guitarist and songwriter Chris Walla decided to part ways with the band, with his last performance occurring on September 13, 2014 at the Rifflandia Music Festival in Victoria, British Columbia. Walla states that he plans to \"...continue making music, producing records, and erring on the side of benevolence and beauty whenever possible.\" When asked in an interview about Walla's involvement in the eighth album, McGerr confirmed that Walla \"played on everything and has been involved all the way through, even in the mixing. Even though he's played his last show with us, he's still been involved in everything involving this record.\"\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Cab+for+Cutie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Armed with turntables, a killer vibe and an open mind, Alison turns countless dance floors across Australia into your favourite kind of Wonderland: more beats, less croquet.\n\nBeginning with a background in indie and classical, Wonderland's best card is her eclecticism. Throughout her youth she toured Europe as a principal cellist for the Sydney Youth Orchestra and later played bass in a successful local indie band.\n\nAfter inking a global deal with EMI, Wonderland released her debut compilation record - \"Welcome To Wonderland\" mid 2012, while her much anticipated first original's album is due out very soon! If the success of her remixes is anything to go by the record is set to be a game changer.\n\nWonderland has performed in LA at the official Grammy's Afterparty, all throughout Ibiza on top of MOS and the Brit Awards Afterparty in London. In Australia she has torn up main stages at Splendour in the Grass, Falls Festival, Southbound Festival, Stereosonic, Field Day, Parklife (nationally), Good Vibrations Festival, Harbourlife, Sydney Fashion Week, Future Music Festival, Coaster Festival, Secret Garden Festival and more, not to mention her sellout headline national tours.\n\nThe end of 2012 saw Wonderland taking the highly prestigious summer festival time slots. Playing main stage at Falls Festival in a headline slot after Hot Chip to a capacity crowd, Supporting PNAU Live at Wonderland Festival in Perth & again destroying the headline time slot after SBTRKT to a heaving tent at Southbound Festival this all within 1 WEEK!\n\nWonderland is the party, rumour has it she never sleeps and is reasonably good friends with Oprah. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alison+Wonderland\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Tad Kinchla and Ben Wilson joined the band following the death of original bassist Bobby Sheehan in 1999.\n   While Blues Traveler is best known among fans for their improvisational live shows, the general public is most familiar with the group from their Top 40 singles \"Run-Around\" and \"Hook\". They gained mainstream popularity after their fourth studio album four, released in 1994. Sheehan's death and Popper's struggle with obesity put a damper on the group's success, and A&M dropped the band in 2002.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Blues+Traveler\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Vocalist Rachael Price came from outside Nashville, Tennessee, stand-up bassist Bridget Kearney was an Iowa native, while drummer Mike Calabrese called Philadelphia home. “I wasn’t only impressed with their musicianship,” says Olson, who acquired the nickname “McDuck” while at the conservatory for his reclusive ways. “They were also a lot of fun just to hang out with.

    "headlinerBio": "Lynyrd Skynyrd (pronounced /ˌlɛnərd ˈskɪnərd/ LEN-ərd-SKIN-ərd) is a Southern Rock band, formed in Jacksonville, Florida, USA in 1964. The band became prominent in the Southern United States in 1973, and rose to worldwide recognition before three members and one road crew member died in an airplane crash in 1977. The band reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with lead singer Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother Johnny as the frontman. Lynyrd Skynyrd continues to tour and record. Of its original members, only Gary Rossington remains with the band as of 2010. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\n\nIn the summer of 1964, teenage friends Ronnie Van Zant, Allen Collins, and Gary Rossington, formed the band \"The Noble Five\", which then changed in 1965 to \"My Backyard\", when Larry Junstrom and Bob Burns joined in Jacksonville, Florida. Their early influences included British Invasion bands such as Free, The Yardbirds, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles, as well as Southern blues and country & western music. In 1968, the group won a local Battle of the Bands contest and the opening slot on several Southeast shows for the California-based psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock.\n\nIn 1970, Van Zant sought a new name. \"One Percent\" and \"The Noble Five\" were each considered before the group settled on Leonard Skinnerd, a mocking tribute to a physical-education teacher at Robert E. Lee High School, Leonard Skinner, who was notorious for strictly enforcing the school's policy against boys having long hair. The more distinctive spelling was adopted before they released their first album. Despite their high school acrimony, the band developed a friendlier relationship with Skinner in later years, and invited him to introduce them at a concert in the Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum.\n\nIn 1970, the band auditioned for Alan Walden, who would later become their manager on the newly formed Hustler's Inc. Walden worked with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Pete Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving, blues-rock sound and image, and experimenting with making studio recordings.\n\nDuring this time, they went through a number of member changes, with Van Zant, Collins and Rossington remaining the only constants. Burns and Junstrom left the band, and were briefly replaced by Rickey Medlocke on drums and Greg Walker on bass. In 1971, with this lineup, they made some recordings at the famous Muscle Shoals studio. By the time they made a second round of Muscle Shoals recordings in 1972, Burns had rejoined the band and Leon Wilkeson had become Larry Junstrom's permanent replacement on bass, with Medlocke and Walker having left to play with the southern rock band Blackfoot. Around this time, the band occasionally played shows with both Burns and Medlocke participating, utilizing a dual-drummer approach similar to that of The Allman Brothers. Also in 1972, roadie Billy Powell became the keyboardist for the band.\n\nPeak years (1973–1977)\n\nIn 1972 the band was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer Al Kooper of Blood, Sweat, and Tears, who had attended one of their shows at a club in Atlanta. They changed the spelling of their name to \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\", (pronounced 'lĕh-'nérd 'skin-'nérd) and Kooper signed them to MCA Records, producing their first album (pronounced 'lĕh-'nérd 'skin-'nérd). Leon Wilkeson left just before the band was to record the album (Wilkeson rejoined the band shortly thereafter at Van Zant's invitation and is pictured on the album cover).[citation needed] Strawberry Alarm Clock guitarist Ed King joined the band and played Wilkeson's parts on the album, along with some guitar. King switched to guitar after the album's release, allowing the band to replicate the three-guitar mix used in the studio. Released January 1, 1973, the album featured the hit song \"Free Bird\", which received national airplay, eventually reaching #19 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, and is still considered a rock and roll anthem today.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd's fan base continued to grow rapidly throughout 1973, largely due to their opening slot on The Who's Quadrophenia tour in the United States. On their 1974 follow-up, Second Helping, the band successfully avoided sophomore slump, with King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting. The album was the band's breakthrough hit, and featured their most popular single, \"Sweet Home Alabama\" (#8 on the charts in August 1974), a response to Neil Young's \"Alabama\" and \"Southern Man.\" (Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other's music and good friends; Young even wrote the song \"Powderfinger\" for the band, but they never recorded it. Van Zant, meanwhile, can be seen on the cover of Street Survivors wearing a Neil Young t-shirt.) The album reached #12 in 1974, eventually going multi-platinum. In July of that year, Lynyrd Skynyrd was one of the headline acts at The Ozark Music Festival at the Missouri State Fairgrounds in Sedalia, Missouri.\n\nIn January, 1975, Burns left the band and was replaced by Kentucky native Artimus Pyle on drums. Lynyrd Skynyrd's third album, Nuthin' Fancy, was released the same year. The album had lower sales than its predecessor, and Kooper was eventually fired. Midway through the tour, Ed King left the band, citing tour exhaustion. In January 1976, backup singers Leslie Hawkins, Cassie Gaines and JoJo Billingsley (collectively known as The Honkettes) were added to the band, although they were not considered as official members. Lynyrd Skynyrd's fourth album Gimme Back My Bullets was released in the new year, but did not achieve the same success as the previous two albums. Van Zant and Collins both felt that the band was seriously missing the three-guitar attack that had been one of its early hallmarks. Although Skynyrd auditioned several guitarists, including such high-profile names as Leslie West, the solution was closer than they realized.\n\nSoon after joining Skynyrd, Cassie Gaines began touting the guitar and songwriting prowess of her younger brother, Steve. The junior Gaines, who led his own band, Crawdad (which occasionally would perform Skynyrd's \"Saturday Night Special\" in their set), was invited to audition onstage with Skynyrd at a concert in Kansas City on May 11, 1976. Liking what they heard, the group also jammed informally with the Oklahoma native several times, then invited him into the group in June. With Gaines on board, the newly-reconstituted band recorded the double-live album One More From the Road at the Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia) in Atlanta, and performed at the Knebworth festival, which also featured The Rolling Stones.\n\nBoth Collins and Rossington had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976 which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington's accident inspired the ominous \"That Smell\" - a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he's the \"Prince Charming\" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on Quaaludes. Van Zant, at least, was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd's reputation.\n\n1977's Street Survivors turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist Steve Gaines, who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them. Publicly and privately, Ronnie Van Zant marveled at the multiple talents of Skynyrd's newest member, claiming that the band would \"all be in his shadow one day.\" Gaines' contributions included his co-lead vocal with Van Zant on the co-written \"You Got That Right\" and the rousing guitar boogie \"I Know A Little\" which he had written before he joined Skynyrd. So confident was Skynyrd's leader of Gaines' abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy \"Ain't No Good Life\" - the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant. The album also included the hit singles \"What's Your Name\" and \"That Smell\". The band was poised for their biggest tour yet, including fulfilling Van Zant's lifelong dream of headlining New York's Madison Square Garden.\n\nPlane crash (1977)\n\nOn Thursday, October 20, 1977, just three days after the release of Street Survivors, and five shows into their most successful headlining tour to date, Lynyrd Skynyrd's chartered Convair 240 ran out of fuel near the end of their flight from Greenville, South Carolina, where they had just performed at the Greenville Memorial Auditorium, to LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Though the pilots attempted an emergency landing on a small airstrip, the plane crashed in a forest in Gillsburg, Mississippi. Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary and co-pilot William Gray were all killed on impact; the other bandmembers suffered serious injuries.\n\nFollowing the crash and the ensuing press, Street Survivors became the band's second platinum album and reached #5 on the U.S. album chart. The single \"What's Your Name\" reached #13 on the single airplay charts in January 1978.\n\nThe original cover sleeve for Street Survivors had featured a photograph of the band, particularly Steve Gaines, engulfed in flames. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve's widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with a similar image of the band against a simple black background. Thirty years later, for the deluxe CD version of Street Survivors, the original \"flames\" cover was restored.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd disbanded after the tragedy, reuniting just once to perform an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\" at Charlie Daniels' Volunteer Jam in January 1979. Collins, Rossington, Powell and Pyle performed the song with Charlie Daniels and members of his band. Leon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley and Leslie Hawkins.\n\nHiatus (1977–1987)\n\nRossington, Collins, Wilkeson and Powell formed The Rossington-Collins Band, which released two albums between 1980 and 1982. Deliberately avoiding comparisons with Ronnie Van Zant as well as suggestions that this band was Lynyrd Skynyrd reborn, Rossington and Collins chose a woman, Dale Krantz, as lead vocalist. However, as an acknowledgment of their past, the band's concert encore would always be an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\". Rossington and Collins eventually had a falling out over the affections of Dale Krantz, whom Rossington married and with whom he formed the Rossington Band, which released two albums in the late 1980s and opened for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987-1988.\n\nThe other former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era.Leon Wilkeson on bass and  Billy Powellon keyboards played  in a Christian Rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker Mylon LeFevre (who, like Skynyrd, had once opened for The Who). During Vision concerts, Powell's trademark keyboard talent was often spotlighted and he spoke about his conversion to Christianity after the near-fatal plane crash. Pyle formed The Artimus Pyle Band in 1982, which occasionally featured former Honkettes JoJo Billingsley and Leslie Hawkins.\n\nIn 1980 Allen Collins' wife Kathy died of a massive hemorrhage while miscarrying their third child. He formed the Allen Collins Band in 1983 from the remnants of the Rossington-Collins Band, releasing one tepidly-received album, but many around him believed that the guitarist's heart just wasn't in it anymore. Most point to his wife's death as the moment that Collins' life began to spin out of control; he spent several years bingeing on drugs and alcohol. In 1986 Collins crashed his car while driving drunk near his home in Jacksonville, killing his girlfriend and leaving him permanently paralyzed from the chest down. Collins eventually pled no contest to DUI manslaughter, but was not given a prison sentence since his injuries made it obvious that he would never drive or be a danger to society again.\n\nReturn (1987–present)\n\nIn 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with five major members of the post-crash band: crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson and Artimus Pyle, along with guitarist Ed King, who had left the band two years before the crash. Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother, Johnny, took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to Collins' paralysis from the 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. As part of his plea deal, Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform (usually before the performance of \"That Smell\", which had been partially directed at him). Collins was stricken with pneumonia in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990.\n\nThe reunited band was meant to be a one-time tribute to the original lineup, captured on the double-live album Southern By The Grace Of God/Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour - 1987. The fact that the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not \"exploit\" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso which forces any band touring as \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\" to include at least two from among Rossington, Collins, Powell, Pyle, Wilkeson and King. Apparently, that proviso is not being enforced, seeing that Rossington is now the sole member of that group left in Lynyrd Skynyrd, as King was not allowed to remain in the band after missing a tour unable to tour due to heart problems, Pyle is on the outs with Rossington and Johnny Van Zant, and the others are now dead. Pyle has insisted in public appearances that \"Ronnie Van Zandt IS Lynyrd Skynyrd\", and wishes nothing to do with the current makeup of the band bearing that name. Two other founding members of the band remain alive, original drummer Bob Burns and bassist Larry Junstrom Bob Burns, but they have not participated in the post-crash band.\n\nThe reconstituted Lynyrd Skynyrd has gone through a large number of lineup changes and continues to record and tour today. One by one, the members of the pre-crash band have left, been forced out, or have passed away. Artimus Pyle left the band in 1991 and his place has been taken by a variety of drummers since, with Michael Cartellone finally becoming his permanent replacement. Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes in 1993. Ed King had to take a break from touring in 1996. In his absence, he was replaced by Hughie Thomasson. King has stated that his break from the band was to be temporary, but the band did not let him rejoin after he recovered. At the same time, Mike Estes was replaced by Rickey Medlocke, who had briefly played drums with the band in the early 1970's. Leon Wilkeson, Skynyrd's bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001; his death was found to be due to emphysema and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by Ean Evans. The remaining members released a double album called Thyrty which had songs from the original line up to the present. Lynyrd Skynyrd also released a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour and on June 22, 2004, Lynyrd Skynyrd released the album Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour. On December 10, 2004, Lynyrd Skynyrd did a show for CMT, Crossroads, a concert featuring country duo Montgomery Gentry and other genres of music. In the beginning of 2005 Hughie Thomasson left the band to reform his disbanded Southern Rock band Outlaws. Thomasson died in his sleep on September 9, 2007 of an apparent heart attack in his home in Brooksville, Florida. He was 55 years old.\n\nOn February 5, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd did a Super Bowl party back in Jacksonville with special guests 3 Doors Down, Jo Dee Messina, Charlie Daniels and Ronnie and Johnny Van Zant's brother Donnie Van Zant of 38 Special. On February 13 of that year Lynyrd Skynyrd did a tribute to Southern Rock on the Grammy Awards with Gretchen Wilson, Tim McGraw, Keith Urban and Dickey Betts. On May 10, 2005, Johnny and Donnie Van Zant released a country album called Get Right with the Man which featured the hit single \"Help Somebody\". In the summer of 2005, lead singer Johnny Van Zant had to have surgery on his vocal cord to have a polyp removed. He was told not to sing for three months. On September 10, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd performed without Johnny Van Zant at the Music Relief Concert for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, with Kid Rock standing in for Johnny. In December 2005, Johnny Van Zant returned to sing for Lynyrd Skynyrd. The band performed live at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, as a part of their 2007 tour. The concert was recorded in high definition for HDNet and premiered on December 1, 2007.\nThe band in 2008\n\nMark \"Sparky\" Matejka, formerly of the country music band Hot Apple Pie, joined Lynyrd Skynyrd in 2006 as Thomasson's replacement. On November 2, 2007, the band performed at Gator Growl, the world's largest student-run pep rally, in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium - also known as \"The Swamp.\" The event's 50,000-person attendance marked the largest crowd that Lynyrd Skynyrd had ever played in front of in the United States, until the July 2008 Bama Jam in Enterprise, Alabama where more than 111,000 people were in attendance.\n\nOn January 28, 2009, keyboardist Billy Powell died at age 56 at his home near Jacksonville, Florida. Powell called 911 at 12:55 a.m., complaining of shortness of breath. He had previously missed his doctor's appointment on the day before his death; the appointment was for a checkup on his heart. The EMS responders found Powell unconscious and unresponsive, with the telephone still in his hand. Rescue crews performed CPR, but he was pronounced dead at 1:52 a.m. Although a heart attack was suspected, and it was originally reported that an autopsy was to be performed, none in fact was ever done. Powell's death left Gary Rossington as the sole pre-crash member of the band, unless Rickey Medlocke's brief stint with the band in the early 1970's is counted. On March 17, 2009, it was announced that Skynyrd had signed a worldwide deal with Roadrunner Records, in association with their label, Loud & Proud Records, and released their new album God & Guns on September 29 of that year. They toured Europe and the United States in 2009 with Peter Keys of the 420 Funk Mob on keyboards and Robert Kearns of The Bottle Rockets on bass (in place of Ean Evans, who died of cancer at age 48 on May 6, 2009, at his home in Columbus, Mississippi). Scottish rock band Gun have been confirmed as special guests for the UK leg of Skynyrds tour in 2010.\n\nLeonard Skinner, the physical education teacher who inspired the name Lynyrd Skynyrd passed away on September 21st, 2010 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lynyrd+Skynyrd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The Revivalists is an American rock band formed in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2007. The 7-piece band consists of Ed Williams (pedal steel guitar, guitar), David Shaw (lead vocals), Zack Feinberg (guitar), Rob Ingraham (saxophone), George Gekas (bass guitar), Andrew Campanelli (drums, percussion), and Michael Girardot (keyboards, trumpet). The group's sound has been described as \"a Crescent City-rhythm spin on jam-band jubilee.\"\n\nSince forming in 2007, the band's combination of danceable rock and soulful songwriting (and brilliantivity) has come to life through a meticulously-crafted and ever-evolving live performance. The band has been instrumental in the growth of New Orleans’ burgeoning indie rock scene, and they have achieved success and notoriety in the city’s competitive musical landscape.\n\nThe Revivalists have proven themselves as a live act.  They have managed to advance from low-profile local gigs to extensive touring, developing a loyal fan base at home and across the Gulf Coast Region and gaining footholds nationally. Abroad, they have commanded such venues as The Kennedy Center (Washington, DC), Sullivan Hall (New York City), Toad’s Place (New Haven, CT), and Smith’s Olde Bar (Atlanta, GA). At home, The Revivalists are regulars at The Howlin’ Wolf, The Republic, and the legendary Tipitina’s. They have shared stages with such notable acts as Perpetual Groove, Marco Benevento, Rebirth Brass Band, Ivan Neville’s Dumpstaphunk, The Lee Boys and Snarky Puppy. Additionally, they have established themselves as an engaging festival act, winning over audiences at French Quarter Fest, Crawfest and Foburg Festival in New Orleans, Hamstock Barbecue and Music Festival in Ridgeland, MS, and The Duke Ellington Jazz Festival in Washington, DC. Most recently, The Revivalists played the 2010 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. There, they caught the attention of Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke, who wrote about their performance on his blog on rollingstone.com.\n\nThe Revivalists have also grown as studio musicians. Their first release was listed as an editor’s pick in both the Jam and American Traditional Rock categories on CDBaby.com, despite being a humble five-song EP. Their second release, Vital Signs, is both the band’s first full-length album and a significant step forward in terms of production and scale. The young band was privileged to record under the guidance of Grammy Award-winning producer Chris Finney, whose resumé ranges from Dr. John to R.E.M. Vital Signs is the result of this collaboration. Soon after its release, Vital Signs became the top-selling album on CDBaby in the American Traditional Rock category, and was quickly selected to be featured in their newsletter. \n\nMembers:\nGeorge Gekas (bass)\nAndrew Campanelli (drums)\nZack Feinberg (guitar)\nDavid Shaw (vocals, guitar)\nEd “Steel” Williams (pedal steel guitar)\nRob Ingraham (saxophone, miscellaneous/other) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Revivalists\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Trampled By Turtles (TBT) is an indie folk band from Duluth, Minnesota. The group is most famous for both its fast-paced songs and plaintive ballads. Their high-energy concerts have attracted an ever-growing, dedicated fan following. The band members have referenced inspirations such as Townes Van Zandt, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ralph Stanley. Their fifth release, Palomino, has maintained a position in the Top 10 on the Billboard bluegrass charts for 52 straight weeks. Their music has been featured in TV shows including Deadliest Catch and Squidbillies. Their sixth studio album, Stars and Satellites, was released on April 10, 2012.\n\nThe band has performed at many national festivals including Coachella, Stagecoach, Summerfest, Bumbershoot, and Pickathon. In 2011, they performed at several large folk festivals such as Telluride Bluegrass Festival, Newport Folk Festival and 2011 ROMP roots and branches. They are scheduled to play the Sasquatch Festival, Bonnaroo, All Good Music Festival, Newport Folk Festival, and Lollapalooza in 2012.\n\n2014 saw the release of Trampled by Turtles's seventh studio album, Wild Animals, on July 15th. The band tapped Alan Sparhawk, from the band Low, to produce Wild Animals. Sparhawk's influence is evident in the band's seemingly more alternative, high lonesome sound. The night of Wild Animals' release, TBT made their second appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman. On August 16th, Trampled by Turtles headlined a sold out show at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, CO.\n\nhttp://www.trampledbyturtles.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Trampled+by+Turtles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Stick Figure is a reggae band from California. All music is created by singer Scott Woodruff. Until 2009 he lived in Duxbury, Massachusetts, as Stick Figure all alone. After a long trip to NZ and Bali, he 2011 moved to San Diego to put together a band. 2012 he released the 5th Stick Figure album, Burial Ground. It reached no. 1 on iTunes and Billboard Reggae charts, and has songs as 'Breathe' and 'Weight Of Sound (feat. TJ O'Neill) '. The band then toured in USA with other reggae groups. (Rebelution, The Green, Passafire, Tribal Seeds, The Expendables). The 6th album, Set In Stone (2015) included collaborations with Collie Buddz (the song 'Smokin’ Love (ft. Collie Buddz)'). Also with Eric Rachmany and Slightly Stoopid. Again they topped Billboard Reggae Albums Chart.\n_   _   _\n\nPossessing a unique style of music that combines a creative blend of upbeat roots reggae with the reverberating echoes of dub, comes a man with no limit for his musical abilities. Stick Figure's music is written, recorded, and produced by Scott Woodruff, a young man from Duxbury, MA.\n\nAll of Stick Figure's songs are made by recording each instrument separately, layering several tracks on top of one another in unison.\n\nStick Figure recently relocated to Southern California and has picked up three new members for the live band, Brendan Dane (San Diego) on bass, Todd Smith (San Clemente) on drums and Kevin Bong (San Diego) on keys. All are incredible musicians and are surely a great addition to the Stick Figure sound. The band is currently in the process of recording their first debut album together, expecting to drop this Winter.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stick+Figure\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "On Jan 10th, 2012 the Santa Barbara, CA based band Rebelution released \"Peace of Mind\" through their own label 87 Music in partnership with Controlled Substance Sound Labs. Peace of Mind was released as a multi-length triple album which includes Peace of Mind: Acoustic as well as Peace of Mind: Dub. Marking the highest chart debut of Rebelution’s career, Peace of Mind debuted at #13 on the Billboard Top 200, #1 Reggae and #1 Independent albums as well as #4 on the iTunes overall album chart. The band previously had four top 10 albums on the Reggae chart and their 2009 release Bright Side of Life debuted at No. 54 on the Top 200 and #1 Reggae.\n\nRebelution kicked off their “Peace of Mind Tour” the day after the release, selling out shows at Philly’s The Electric Factory, The Hollywood Palladium, Denver’s The Fillmore, The Fox Theater in Oakland and Hard Rock in Orlando, FL. The tour made stops in a total of 42 cities across the country.\n\nSummer 2012 was spent supporting O.A.R on their Amphitheatre tour, headlining four amphitheaters in Florida as well as festival performances at Outside Lands, Hangout, Forecastle, Summer Camp, Summer Set, The Allman Bro’s Peach Festival and two performances at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. After completing a Fall tour of the East and South East, Rebelution will be headlining The Hollywood Palladium on New Years Eve, heading to New Zealand for the Raggamuffins Festival in February and headlining their annual Winter Greens Tour around the USA in Feb - May 2013. \n\nPeace of Mind marks the first time Rebelution has expanded beyond their usual self-production enlisting producers Michael Goldwasser (Easy Star All-Stars), Amp Live (Zion-I), Yeti Beats (Kool Keith, George Clinton), Keith Armstrong and Errol Brown (Stephen, Ziggy, Damian, and Bob Marley). The album builds upon the band’s signature style while venturing into new musical genres from the lush strings incorporated into the gentle “Route Around” to the driving guitar and synths throughout “Lady In White”.\n\nRebelution has developed into a front-runner for grassroots, independent and tour driven music groups. Originally formed in 2004, members Eric Rachmany (vocals / guitar), Rory Carey (keyboards), Wesley Finley (drums), and Marley D. Williams (bass) met in college, while residing in Isla Vista, a popular beachside community in Santa Barbara. It was there that the seeds to Rebelution’s future were planted creating inspiring and engaging music that would leave their listeners with the sense that they have the power to make this world a better place. The band continuously tours across the country, ventured to South America and Europe, and has previously performed at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits among others.\n \nContact:\nManagement:  Silverback Artist Management / Raise Up Music\nDean Raise – dean@raiseupentertainment.com\nJon Phillips – Jon@silverbackmusic.net\n \nBooking – Paradigm Agency\nAaron Pinkus – apinkus@paradigmagency.com\n \nJamie Simone\nPFA Media\njsimone@pfamedia.net\n212-334-6116 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rebelution\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The Black Crowes was a blues-oriented hard rock jam band formed 1989 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States that has sold over 15 million albums and were hailed by Melody Maker as \"The Most Rock N' Roll Rock N' Roll Band In The World\" The band has toured with acts such as Aerosmith, ZZ Top, Jimmy Page, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Oasis and Lenny Kravitz. The Crowes are listed at #92 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".\n\nAt the time of their 1990 debut, the kind of rock & roll the Black Crowes specialize in was out of style. Only Guns N' Roses came close to approximating a vintage Stones-style raunch, but they were too angry and jagged to pull it off completely. The Black Crowes replicated that Stonesy swagger and Faces boogie perfectly. Vocalist Chris Robinson appropriated the sound and style of vintage Rod Stewart while guitarist Rich Robinson fused Keith Richards' lean attack with Ron Wood's messy rhythmic sense. At their best, the Black Crowes echo classic rock without slavishly imitating their influences.\n\nThe Robinson brothers originally formed the Black Crowes in Georgia in 1984. By the time of their 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker, the group comprised Chris Robinson (vocals), Rich Robinson (guitar), Johnny Colt (bass), Jeff Cease (guitar), and Steve Gorman (drums). \"Jealous Again,\" the first single from Shake Your Money Maker, was a moderate hit but it was the band's cover of Otis Redding's \"Hard to Handle\" that made the group a multi-platinum success. \"Hard to Handle\" climbed its way into the Top 40, propelling the album into the Top Ten. The acoustic ballad \"She Talks to Angels\" became the band's second Top 40 hit in the spring of 1991. Shake Your Money Maker would eventually sell over three million copies.\n\nThe Black Crowes delivered their second album, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, in the spring of 1992, adding new lead guitarist Marc Ford and keyboardist Eddie Harsch. It entered the charts at number one, but it didn't have as many hit singles as the debut; none of the singles cracked the Top 40 and only \"Remedy\" and \"Thorn in My Pride\" made the Top 100. Nevertheless, the band established themselves as a popular concert attraction that summer, selling out theaters across America. The Black Crowes' third album, Amorica, arrived in late 1994. Amorica debuted in the Top Ten, but none of the singles from the album made the charts; even though the record went gold, it slipped off the charts in early 1995.\n\nThree Snakes & One Charm, the group's fourth album, was released in July of 1996. The album entered the charts at number 15, but it quickly slipped out of the Top 50. Nevertheless, the album received the best reviews of any Crowes album since The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. Guitarist Marc Ford was fired from the Black Crowes in August, 1997; two years later, the group returned with By Your Side. In mid-2000, the band collaborated with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page on the double-disc Live at the Greek, an eclectic mix of newly recorded Zeppelin covers and additional classic blues cuts. A Tribute to a Work in Progress: Greatest Hits 1990-1999, a 16-track best-of compilation was also released in mid-2000. The Don Was-produced Lions appeared in spring 2001, and a summer tour with Oasis -- the Tour of Brotherly Love -- followed in June. But all was apparently not well with the group, in January of 2002 the band announced that they were on hiatus. Drummer Steve Gorman was fired from the band, and Chris Robinson announced his intentions for a solo career.\n\nThe Black Crowes have since reunited.  All members circa 1992 are back, with the addition of one of their previous bassists, Sven Pipien, and harmony singers Mona Lisa Young and Charity White.  They are enjoying a renaissance within the group as well as with their longtime fan base and have been consistently touring since formally reuniting in March 2005.  In November of 2007, it was announced that North Mississippi Allstar guitarist Luther Dickinson formally joined the band, replacing Paul Stacey. He appears throughout the Crowes' album Warpaint, which was released in March of 2008.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Black+Crowes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Comprised of Jon Gutwillig (vocals/guitar), Marc Brownstein (vocals/bass), Aron Magner (keyboard/vocals), and Allen Aucoin (drums), the quartet continues to bridge the gap between the jamband and electronica/dance worlds by drawing on elements from seemingly disparate genres. This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country. \n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein). \n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee. Bandmembers from both Umphrey's and Bisco have further more found each other in the Brain Damaged Eggmen, a Pink Floyd and Beatles coverband \n\n\nDiscography\n\n    * Encephalous Crime (self-released, 1996)\n    * Uncivilized Area (1998)\n    * Bisco Lives (2000)\n    * They Missed the Perfume (2001)\n    * Señor Boombox (2002)\n    * TranceFusion Radio Broadcast Vol. 1-4 (2003)\n    * Wind at Four to Fly (2006)\n    * Rocket 3 (2007)\n    * Planet Anthem (2010) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Disco+Biscuits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Jackson Stell, known by his stage name of Big Wild, is an electronic DJ, producer, composer, and engineer. \n\nStell was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts. When he was only 14, Stell started making hip-hop influenced beats under the name \"JBeats\". However, it wasn't until his girlfriend took him to Big Sur California in 2012 that he began making music under the name Big Wild. Stell said in an interview with 303 Magazine, \"I never really had witnessed a landscape like that before being from Massachusetts. It made me want to do a music project where I could be adventurous, unique and big with my sound.\" Once under the name Big Wild, Stell began producing distinctively atmospheric, groove-oriented tracks.\n\nIn 2015, through Stell's Soundcloud, the Seattle-based electronic music duo ODESZA, had been exposed to his music and enjoyed it. ODESZA asked Stell to open for them at the San Francisco and LA stops of their tour, and Stell eventually joined them on their whole tour after he finished and released his remix of ODESZA's track \"Say My Name.\"\n\nIn 2016, Big Wild's track \"Aftergold\", featuring Tove Styrke, amassed millions of plays on many networks, such as Soundcloud and Youtube, and Stell started touring with other DJs and producers including GRiZ, Tycho, Pretty Lights, and Bassnectar.\n\nBig Wild's first EP, The Invincible EP, was released in early 2017 on ODESZA's Foreign Family Collective label, and included the single \"I Just Wanna\" plus features for Yuna and iDA HAWK. Big Wild released his debut album, Superdream, on February 1st, 2019 on all major platforms.\n\nStell set out on his own tour in spring 2017, hitting 27 dates around America.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Wild\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard are an Australian psychedelic rock band that formed in 2010 in Melbourne, Victoria. The band consists of Stu Mackenzie (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, flute), Ambrose Kenny-Smith (vocals, harmonica, keyboards), Cook Craig (guitar, bass, vocals), Joey Walker (guitar, bass, keyboards, vocals), Lucas Skinner (bass, keyboards), Michael Cavanagh (drums, percussion), and Eric Moore (drums, percussion, management). They are known for their energetic live shows and prolific recording output, having released two EPs and 15 studio albums since their formation.\n\nTheir EP and first two albums, Willoughby's Beach (2011), 12 Bar Bruise (2012) and Eyes Like the Sky (2013), primarily blended surf music and garage rock, and were released on the band's independent record label, Flightless, founded by Moore in 2012. Their third to eighth albums—Float Along – Fill Your Lungs (2013), Oddments, I'm in Your Mind Fuzz (2014), Quarters!, Paper Mâché Dream Balloon[/akbum] (2015) and Nonagon Infinity (2016)—expanded their sound, including elements of film music, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, folk, jazz, soul and heavy metal.\n\nIn 2017, the band fulfilled a promise to release five studio albums within the year: Flying Microtonal Banana in February; Murder of the Universe in June; Sketches of Brunswick East, a collaboration with Mild High Club, in August; Polygondwanaland, which was released into the public domain, in November; and Gumboot Soup in December. The band released its fourteenth album, Fishing for Fishies, on 26 April 2019, followed by a fifteenth album, Infest the Rats' Nest, released on 16 August that year.\n\nOn the 19th of April they released their first feature-length film, concert movie \"Chunky Shrapnel\". Named after a lyric from the band’s 2017 song Murder Of The Universe, The film combines concert footage from the band’s 2019 European tour with documentary style-filmmaking of King Gizzard behind the scenes. While Chunky Shrapnel does also document the band offstage, the film’s director, Josh Angus Stewart, said that it prioritizes music over personalities. \n\nChunky Shrapnel was originally set to premiere at Melbourne’s Astor Theatre, before the Australian government closed cinemas nationwide to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The film was eventually released and finally available for 24 hours only on vimeo. \n\nThe band members all grew up and went to school in the Deniliquin, Melbourne and Geelong areas. The band started off as a group of friends jamming together, before a mutual friend asked them to play at a show. The band's name was created \"last minute\". Mackenzie wanted to name the band \"Gizzard Gizzard\" while another band member wanted Jim Morrison's nickname \"Lizard King\". They eventually compromised with King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. The artist Jason Galea has created all of the band's album art, and a majority of their music videos.\n\nOn the 25th of August 2020 it was announced that Eric will no longer be an active member or manager of the band, while promising to keep working with them to put out records in the future. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/King+Gizzard+&+The+Lizard+Wizard\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Chicago is an American rock band formed in 1967 in Chicago, Illinois. The self-described \"rock and roll band with horns\" began as a politically charged, sometimes experimental, rock band and later moved to a predominantly softer sound, generating several hit ballads. They had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Second only to The Beach Boys in Billboard singles and albums chart success among American bands, Chicago is one of the longest-running and most successful rock groups in history.\n\nAccording to Billboard, Chicago was the leading US singles charting group during the 1970s. They have sold over 38 million units in the US, with 22 gold, 18 platinum, and 8 multi-platinum albums. Over the course of their career they have had five number-one albums and 21 top-ten singles.\n\nThere are at least two artists with this name:\n1. A popular American rock band\n2. A psytrance artist\n(If you are scrobbling tracks here from Chicago - Music From The Miramax Motion Picture, please fix your tags.)\n3. A Japanese vocalist named CHICACO but weirdly gets redirected here. She's been active in LYDIA GRAVE and the touhou arrangement circle ESQUARIA.\n\nThe second Chicago is a psytrance artist, the pseudonym of David Potter Christman. He is a member of 1200 Micrograms <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chicago\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Trevor Hall (born in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, on 28 November 1986) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. His music is a mix of roots, folk, and reggae. Many of Hall's themes revolve around spirituality and life exploration.\n\nHis father was a drummer and a musician. For his 15th or 16th birthday, his father got him some time in his friend's recording studio. He made his first record, which was mostly sold to his friends and family. At Idyllwild School for the Arts, an international boarding school east of Los Angeles, he studied classical guitar. In his senior year of high school, he signed a record deal with Geffen Records. After graduation, he moved to LA and began working with producers such as John Alagia (John Mayer, Jason Mraz, Dave Matthews) and The Laboriel Brothers (Sting, Paul Mccartney). Other than an EP, none of the recordings he made with Geffen ever came out. He was dropped from the label in 2008. \n\nSubsequently, he toured and played with acts such as Steel Pulse, The Wailers, Matisyahu, Stevie Nicks, Ben Harper, Colbie Caillat, Los Lobos, Ziggy Marley, Rusted Root, and many others. \n\nHis album, KALA, written in Hawaii and recorded in Los Angeles, was released on August 21, 2015. It debuted at No. 2 on the iTunes singer-songwriter chart.[1]\n\nReleased on June 1st, 2018, The Fruitful Darkness was Hall's first completely independent release.\n\ntrevorhallmusic.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Trevor+Hall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Comprised of Jon Gutwillig (vocals/guitar), Marc Brownstein (vocals/bass), Aron Magner (keyboard/vocals), and Allen Aucoin (drums), the quartet continues to bridge the gap between the jamband and electronica/dance worlds by drawing on elements from seemingly disparate genres. This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country. \n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein). \n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee. Bandmembers from both Umphrey's and Bisco have further more found each other in the Brain Damaged Eggmen, a Pink Floyd and Beatles coverband \n\n\nDiscography\n\n    * Encephalous Crime (self-released, 1996)\n    * Uncivilized Area (1998)\n    * Bisco Lives (2000)\n    * They Missed the Perfume (2001)\n    * Señor Boombox (2002)\n    * TranceFusion Radio Broadcast Vol. 1-4 (2003)\n    * Wind at Four to Fly (2006)\n    * Rocket 3 (2007)\n    * Planet Anthem (2010) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Disco+Biscuits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Ben Harper (born in Pomona, CA, on 28 October 1969) is an American  Grammy-winning singer and songwriter. As well as solo albums, he has recorded as Ben Harper and Tom Freund, Ben Harper & The Innocent Criminals, Ben Harper And The Blind Boys Of Alabama, Ben Harper and Relentless7, Ben Harper & Charlie Musselwhite, and Ben & Ellen Harper. \n\nHarper grew up listening to blues, folk, soul, RnB, and reggae. Harper's blend of groove-laden funky soul and folky handcrafted acoustics helped him to gain cult status during the course of the 1990s and widespread attention toward the end of the decade. Harper combines elements of classic folk singers, blues revivalists and jam bands and is embraced by critics and college kids alike. Harper's body of work sells consistently and he tours constantly, building a solid, dedicated fan base.\n\nHarper began playing guitar as a child in his hometown of Claremont, California (in California's Inland Empire). He eventually specialized in the acoustic slide guitar (Weissenborn guitars). As a young man, he recorded an LP (Pleasure and Pain) with fellow folk guitarist Tom Freund. After this limited edition record, Harper got a record deal with Virgin Records, who released his debut album, Welcome to the Cruel World (1994).\n\nThis was followed by the incendiary Fight For Your Mind (1995) which became a college radio favorite and generated an abundance of songs which still fill his set list to this day.\nIn 1999 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, Harper met Jack Johnson, who was unknown at the time and had not recorded. Harper obtained a demo tape of 12 of Johnson's songs that he forwarded to his producer, J.P. Plunier, with whom Johnson recorded his first album. \n\nFrom early on in his career, his music received more attention in Europe than it did in his home country. While he was a well-known and respected figure in the States, in countries like France, Germany, Switzerland, Portugal, and The Netherlands he was a star, receiving a great deal of airplay and critical acclaim. His popularity in Europe is such that he was French Rolling Stone Magazine's \"Artist of the Year\" (Artiste De L'Année) in 2003, and his tour that year for Diamonds on the Inside played to packed arenas across the continent. \n\nIn 2004, Harper recorded the album \"There Will Be a Light\t\" as the collaboration Ben Harper and The Blind Boys of Alabama. \n\nIn October 2004, Harper participated in the Vote for Change concert tour organised to benefit Moveon.org and encourage people in the swing states to vote during the 2004 U.S. presidential election.\n\nOver the summer of 2005, when the Zooma tour scheduled with Trey Anastasio and various side stage performers was cancelled, Harper took on a tour of more private clubs/venues such as the Avalon Ballroom in Boston, the Tabernacle in Atlanta, and a full-band acoustic performance at the historic Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, TN. This series of concerts saw the debut of a number of new Harper songs, such as \"Get It Like You Like It\" and \"Dressed In Black.\"\n\nIn 2006, Harper released the double album Both Sides of the Gun which debuted at #7 on the Billboard charts.\nNext Harper did a worldwide tour, with support from Damian \"Jr. Gong\" Marley on the North American leg.\nIn 2007, Harper released the album Lifeline, recorded in Paris just after his tour.\n\nIn 2009, Harper recorded the album \"White Lies for Dark Times\", as the collaboration Ben Harper and Relentless7. \n\nIn 2014, Harper recorded the album \"Childhood Home\" as the collaboration Ben & Ellen Harper. \n\nIn 2018, Harper recorded the album \"No Mercy in This Land\" as the collaboration Ben Harper & Charlie Musselwhite.  At the 40th Blues Music Awards ceremony, Harper's joint composition with Charlie Musselwhite, \"No Mercy In This Land\", was named as 'Song of the Year'.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Harper\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "The String Cheese Incident (SCI) is a US jam band formed in Crested Butte, Colorado in 1993. The band's music has elements of bluegrass as well as rock, electronica, calypso, country, funk, jazz, Latin, progressive rock, reggae, and occasional psychedelia. All members write original compositions and sing.\n\nFrom playing local gigs at ski resorts in exchange for free lift tickets, the band is composed of Michael Kang (acoustic/electric mandolin, electric guitar, and violin), Michael Travis (drums and percussion), Bill Nershi (acoustic guitar, lap steel guitar, and electric slide guitar), Kyle Hollingsworth (piano, organ, Rhodes, and accordion), and Keith Moseley (bass guitar), and, in 2006, Jason Hann (auxiliary percussion).\n\nThe String Cheese Incident has been described as a democratic ensemble rather than a band, since all of the members contribute their own original compositions to the group’s burgeoning library and share the vocal burden on a number of cover versions as well as their own songs. If a de facto leader had to be named, such a title would probably fall upon Nershi, who is responsible for the bulk of the group’s original song library.\n\nFrom their management, Madison House Inc.:\n\n\"The String Cheese Incident has emerged as one of America’s most significant independent bands.

They have been recognized for their commitment to musical creativity and integrity, for their community spirit, philanthropic endeavors, and for their innovative approach to the business of music. \n \nWhen The String Cheese Incident’s growth first started gaining momentum over a decade ago, when the internet was just beginning to take hold and the major-label business model was failing, the band decided to make music on their own terms. \n \nSince then, The String Cheese Incident has gone on to carve out a completely different approach to the business of music; they are truly pioneers of a new way of “making a band.”  With the World Wide Web as their tool, SCI was among the first artists to disseminate information via the internet, such as tour dates, release information, and other news, to their growing fan base.  Rather than doing business on such terms as “the bottom line,” The String Cheese Incident put their music and their fans first, opening companies of their own, including a ticketing company, a merchandise company and a fan travel agency, to best serve their community. The band’s record label, SCI Fidelity Records, has always operated under the same ideals. Even early on, SCI Fidelity embraced downloadable music and file sharing, delivering SCI’s “On the Road” series, where every show the band plays is made available for download on the internet.  Whether they realized it at the time or not, The String Cheese Incident was inventing grassroots band development.  Today, literally hundreds of bands are using some version of this same approach to building a band.  \n \nThe String Cheese Incident’s commitment goes well beyond their immediate community, and even beyond the music community as a whole. Early on, the band took a serious interest in giving back to the communities that they visited, and they were among the first performers to encourage “Green” shows and tours.  SCI’s support has helped give rise to such not-for-profit organizations as Conscious Alliance, Rock the Earth, and Head Count. In 2002, when the band’s right to sell tickets to their own shows became threatened by ticketing giant Ticketmaster, the band stood strong for the independent music community and filed a lawsuit against the company.  All the while, The String Cheese Incident has stayed committed to music as a creative endeavor, not just in their recordings but also in their live performances.  The list of SCI’s special guests and collaborators is long and diverse.

    "headlinerBio": "The String Cheese Incident (SCI) is a US jam band formed in Crested Butte, Colorado in 1993. The band's music has elements of bluegrass as well as rock, electronica, calypso, country, funk, jazz, Latin, progressive rock, reggae, and occasional psychedelia. All members write original compositions and sing.\n\nFrom playing local gigs at ski resorts in exchange for free lift tickets, the band is composed of Michael Kang (acoustic/electric mandolin, electric guitar, and violin), Michael Travis (drums and percussion), Bill Nershi (acoustic guitar, lap steel guitar, and electric slide guitar), Kyle Hollingsworth (piano, organ, Rhodes, and accordion), and Keith Moseley (bass guitar), and, in 2006, Jason Hann (auxiliary percussion).\n\nThe String Cheese Incident has been described as a democratic ensemble rather than a band, since all of the members contribute their own original compositions to the group’s burgeoning library and share the vocal burden on a number of cover versions as well as their own songs. If a de facto leader had to be named, such a title would probably fall upon Nershi, who is responsible for the bulk of the group’s original song library.\n\nFrom their management, Madison House Inc.:\n\n\"The String Cheese Incident has emerged as one of America’s most significant independent bands. Born in 1993 in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, SCI has since released 6 albums, 3 DVDs and countless live recordings from their relentless tour schedule. Their 14 year history is packed full of surreal experiences, epic moments, groundbreaking involvement and huge accomplishments. They have been recognized for their commitment to musical creativity and integrity, for their community spirit, philanthropic endeavors, and for their innovative approach to the business of music. \n \nWhen The String Cheese Incident’s growth first started gaining momentum over a decade ago, when the internet was just beginning to take hold and the major-label business model was failing, the band decided to make music on their own terms. \n \nSince then, The String Cheese Incident has gone on to carve out a completely different approach to the business of music; they are truly pioneers of a new way of “making a band.”  With the World Wide Web as their tool, SCI was among the first artists to disseminate information via the internet, such as tour dates, release information, and other news, to their growing fan base.  Rather than doing business on such terms as “the bottom line,” The String Cheese Incident put their music and their fans first, opening companies of their own, including a ticketing company, a merchandise company and a fan travel agency, to best serve their community. The band’s record label, SCI Fidelity Records, has always operated under the same ideals. Even early on, SCI Fidelity embraced downloadable music and file sharing, delivering SCI’s “On the Road” series, where every show the band plays is made available for download on the internet.  Whether they realized it at the time or not, The String Cheese Incident was inventing grassroots band development.  Today, literally hundreds of bands are using some version of this same approach to building a band.  \n \nThe String Cheese Incident’s commitment goes well beyond their immediate community, and even beyond the music community as a whole. Early on, the band took a serious interest in giving back to the communities that they visited, and they were among the first performers to encourage “Green” shows and tours.  SCI’s support has helped give rise to such not-for-profit organizations as Conscious Alliance, Rock the Earth, and Head Count. In 2002, when the band’s right to sell tickets to their own shows became threatened by ticketing giant Ticketmaster, the band stood strong for the independent music community and filed a lawsuit against the company.  All the while, The String Cheese Incident has stayed committed to music as a creative endeavor, not just in their recordings but also in their live performances.  The list of SCI’s special guests and collaborators is long and diverse. Their annual events such as Horning’s Hideout, and holiday shows such as New Year’s and Halloween, have helped redefine the concert experience and has garnered the band a reputation as live music vibe innovators.\"\n\nSome side groups are eoto, zilla with Jamie Janover, Zuvuya, Honkytonk Homeslice, Billy nershi's Plue Planet, Pangaea, The Trancident & Keller Williams with Moseley Droll and Sipe  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+String+Cheese+Incident\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Many of Hall's themes revolve around spirituality and life exploration.\n\nHis father was a drummer and a musician. For his 15th or 16th birthday, his father got him some time in his friend's recording studio. He made his first record, which was mostly sold to his friends and family. At Idyllwild School for the Arts, an international boarding school east of Los Angeles, he studied classical guitar. In his senior year of high school, he signed a record deal with Geffen Records. After graduation, he moved to LA and began working with producers such as John Alagia (John Mayer, Jason Mraz, Dave Matthews) and The Laboriel Brothers (Sting, Paul Mccartney).

The idea for the project began one day a couple of years ago when Alaina made fun of Patrick for playing tennis in college. A year later the two fled their hometown Denver to spend eight months sailing and exploring the North Atlantic coast. During their adventures they began writing music together documenting their experiences. The Longboat Pass Songfacts reports that  the pair eventually recorded their songs. The resulting album, Cape Dory, is about their time on the seas, the majority of the tracks being about the difficulties they experienced during their trip. \n\nThere other artists with the same name:\n\n2.

    "headlinerBio": "Widespread Panic is a rock band which formed in Athens, Georgia, United States in 1986. The band currently consists of John Bell (vocals, guitar), Jimmy Herirng (guitar), Dave Schools (bass), John \"JoJo\" Hermann (keyboards), Domingo \"Sunny\" Ortiz (percussion) and Todd Nance (drums). The band has previously included Michael Houser (guitar) and George McConnell (guitar) and have released 11 albums.\n\nMichael Houser and John Bell ('JB') met at the University of Georgia at Athens between 1982 and 1984, and began playing music together around town as a duet. JB played solo shows as well. In the Fall of 1984, David Schools saw JB play a solo show at Abbots in Athens. Dave and JB were introduced by a mutual friend. Shortly thereafter, JB & Mike recruited Dave to play bass with them, and from Mike's nickname (\"Panic\"), the band name Widespread Panic was chosen. On February 24, 1985 the band played their first performance as Widespread Panic at the A-Frame house on Weymanda Court in Athens. Mike, JB, & Dave performed around Athens as a trio, occasionally utilizing local drummers. While their shows consisted primarily of cover tunes (by the likes of The Grateful Dead, Van Morrison, Bob Marley, and Traffic, among others), their repertoire did include a handful of original songs: Sleepy Monkey (the band's first original composition), Chilly Water, Space Wrangler, and Coconut (written by JB before joining the band). During this time, the trio also met vocalist Kelly Jo Davis (who is later married to blues guitarist and friend of WP, Tinsley Ellis). Kelly Jo performed frequently with the band throughout 1985 and 1986.\n\nFebruary 6, 1986, Mike recruited high school friend/band mate Todd Nance for a WP gig (an Aid For Africa benefit) at the Mad Hatter Ballroom in Athens, opening for Strawberry Flats (featuring John Keane). This is considered the first \"official\" Widespread Panic show. Todd evidently had a good time, and accepted their offer to join the band. On February 9, 1985, Mike, Dave, and JB, with Joel Morris on drums and Kelly Jo Davis on backing vocals, recorded Monkey Image (Sleepy Monkey) and Coconut Image (Coconut) at Panoramic Recording Studio in Arnoldsville GA, to be released as their first single. The 45rpm vinyl was released (in a pressing of only 500) shortly thereafter on the band's Space Baby label.\n\nDuring the rest of 1986, WP played mainly in Athens, though they did branch out to venues in Macon, GA and South Carolina. Early on, they began playing every Monday night at the Uptown Lounge in Athens, a tradition that would last well into 1988. Along the way, they developed a solid batch of original tunes (in addition to the four originals that they played in 1985), including Stop-Go, C. Brown, Tie Your Shoes, Porch Song, Driving Song, Conrad, Vacation, Postcard, the instrumental Machine, and another instrumental jam that JB later adds lyrics to, titled Cardboard Box. On October 6, 1986, Texan percussionist Domingo S. Ortiz (\"Sunny\"), sat in with the band at the Uptown Lounge for the first time. Sunny continued to perform with the band on numerous occasions in Athens, Macon, and Atlanta, and eventually (late 1988 or early 1989) accepted the band's request for him to join as a full-time member.\n\nDuring 1987, WP continued to play primarily in Georgia, while steadily spreading out to SC, NC, AL, TN, and as far north as Richmond, VA (Dave Schools' hometown). They developed a few more originals along the way, including Barstools & Dreamers, Contentment Blues, I'm Not Alone, and instrumentals L.a. (aka \"Liza's Apartment\"), and The Take Out. JB added lyrics to Cardboard Box, and to another instrumental titled \"Puppet Song\", subsequently renamed Pigeons. Cardboard Box was only played a handful of times before being dropped from the repertoire. In the Fall, the band signed with Landslide Records and recorded their first album, Space Wrangler, at John Keane's Studio in Athens. Guests on the album included Sunny on percussion, David Blackmon on fiddle, Tim White on keyboards, and Alberto Salazarte (of Athens band White Buffalo) on percussion.\n\nIn June of 1988, the first known guest appearance of producer John Keane on stage with the band occurred. Usually playing pedal steel, Keane became another regular guest at special Panic shows.\n\nTheir debut LP, Space Wrangler, established a small fan base and inaugurated several years of constant touring before the band signed to Capricorn Records and released their major label debut, Widespread Panic in 1991. After appearing with the H.O.R.D.E. tours for a few years, the band became one of the most popular new jam bands that arose in the mid-1990s. Their popularity peaked in the late 1990s/early 2000s, as their concert draw benefited from Phish's temporary hiatus. They still have a large draw in the South, where they are most popular. \n\nPlaying as many as 250 shows a year, Panic built a large fan base. True road warriors, Widespread Panic ranked among the top 50 grossing touring acts for eight years running, even without substantial radio airplay, television exposure, or promotion at retail stores. The band holds sellout records at Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver (23 shows), Oak Mountain Amphitheatre near Birmingham, Ala. (17 shows), Philips Arena in Atlanta (11 shows), and UNO Lakefront Arena in New Orleans (18 shows). Not to mention 20 sellouts at San Francisco's Warfield Theatre, seven sellouts across the Bay at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, nine sellouts at Mud Island in Memphis, seven at Memphis' Mid-South Coliseum, and in October 2003 for the popular Halloween shows sold out two concerts at New York's famed Madison Square Garden. To celebrate the release of their first live album, Light Fuse, Get Away, Widespread Panic offered a free \"CD release party\" concert in the streets of hometown Athens. An estimated 100,000 fans descended on the town, transforming it into the largest CD release party in history.\n\nIn August 2002, founding guitarist Michael Houser lost his battle with pancreatic cancer. George McConnell, a long time friend of the band and former Beanland,a Mississippi roots band, member joined in Houser's wake. After Hermann had joined Panic in 1992, McConnell often sat in whenever Panic played in the south. Friends for the past 15 years, Panic and McConnell had often played on the same bill for nearly as long. That longstanding relationship made him the natural choice to continue on with Panic after Michael Houser's death from pancreatic cancer in August of that year. \"It's all about chemistry,\" Schools said. \"We've been friends for 15 years.\" At the end of the summer tour, Panic went back to the studio to record Ball, a testament that, as Houser wished, they would continue as a band.\n\nOn August 2, 2006, the band announced that George McConnell would no longer be playing with the band. John Keane, friend and co-producer of many of the bands albums, provided guitar support for the remainder of the tour, along with Sam Holt. Both had been featured contributors in Widespread Panic concerts since the beginning of the Summer 2006 tour. The following day, the band announced that guitarist Jimmy Herring, who had previously been a member of the 1990s band the Aquarium Rescue Unit and had toured with The Allman Brothers Band and members of The Grateful Dead, would join the band, beginning with the first show of the Fall 2006 tour at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York.\n\nThe band has sold over 3 million albums, and released a total of 15 CDs and five DVDs (including Live at Oak Mountain, which is certified Gold). \n\nIn June 2006, their 9th and most recent studio album, Earth to America, was released. Earth to America was recorded with Terry Manning in Nassau, Bahamas at the beautiful Compass Point Studios. \n\nIn late 2006, Fayetteville, NC native Jimmy Herring took over the reins of the lead guitarist in the band, kicking off their fall tour with three nights at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York.\n\nPanic’s 7th annual New Year’s shows on December 30 and 31 of 2007, marked their 15th and 16th sellout performance at Philips Arena.\n\nThe band released their 10th album, Free Somehow, on February 12, 2008. It, too, was recorded with producer Terry Manning at Compass Point Studios.\n\nFollowing the release of the new studio album, Widespread Panic began to release vintage concert performances from the Widespread Panic Archives. Carbondale 2000 was released on June 10, 2008, followed by Valdosta 1989 released on February 24, 2009, and Huntsville 1996 released on June 23, 2009. The band will continue to dig into their show archives, which encompasses the past 25 years, and release these shows as multi-track recordings.\n\nJune 27, 2008, marked the band's 32nd sold-out show at Red Rocks Amphitheater. This was more than any other band in the venue's history. Mayor John Hickenlooper proclaimed Friday, June 27 \"Widespread Panic Day\" in the City and County of Denver. The same year, Widespread Panic was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame on September 20.\n\nThe band continued to tour throughout the rest of 2008 and the spring of 2009. In the summer of 2009, Widespread Panic teamed up with fellow southern rockers, The Allman Brothers to do a summer and fall co-headlining tour.\n\nIn March 2010, it was announced that Widespread Panic would be releasing a new album entitled Dirty Side Down on May 25, 2010. The band is also releasing Live in the Classic City II, containing music from its 2000 shows.\n\nOn September 29, 2010, Widespread keyboardist Jojo Herman announced that the band would be going on hiatus in 2012. In an interview with the Vanderbilt Hustler, Herman explained, \"Next year will be our 25th anniversary. After that, we're probably going to call it (quits) for awhile. So we're looking forward to next year and going out on a high note.\" \n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Widespread+Panic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Kelly Jo performed frequently with the band throughout 1985 and 1986.\n\nFebruary 6, 1986, Mike recruited high school friend/band mate Todd Nance for a WP gig (an Aid For Africa benefit) at the Mad Hatter Ballroom in Athens, opening for Strawberry Flats (featuring John Keane). This is considered the first \"official\" Widespread Panic show. Todd evidently had a good time, and accepted their offer to join the band. On February 9, 1985, Mike, Dave, and JB, with Joel Morris on drums and Kelly Jo Davis on backing vocals, recorded Monkey Image (Sleepy Monkey) and Coconut Image (Coconut) at Panoramic Recording Studio in Arnoldsville GA, to be released as their first single. The 45rpm vinyl was released (in a pressing of only 500) shortly thereafter on the band's Space Baby label.\n\nDuring the rest of 1986, WP played mainly in Athens, though they did branch out to venues in Macon, GA and South Carolina. Early on, they began playing every Monday night at the Uptown Lounge in Athens, a tradition that would last well into 1988. Along the way, they developed a solid batch of original tunes (in addition to the four originals that they played in 1985), including Stop-Go, C. Brown, Tie Your Shoes, Porch Song, Driving Song, Conrad, Vacation, Postcard, the instrumental Machine, and another instrumental jam that JB later adds lyrics to, titled Cardboard Box. On October 6, 1986, Texan percussionist Domingo S. Ortiz (\"Sunny\"), sat in with the band at the Uptown Lounge for the first time. Sunny continued to perform with the band on numerous occasions in Athens, Macon, and Atlanta, and eventually (late 1988 or early 1989) accepted the band's request for him to join as a full-time member.\n\nDuring 1987, WP continued to play primarily in Georgia, while steadily spreading out to SC, NC, AL, TN, and as far north as Richmond, VA (Dave Schools' hometown). They developed a few more originals along the way, including Barstools & Dreamers, Contentment Blues, I'm Not Alone, and instrumentals L.a. (aka \"Liza's Apartment\"), and The Take Out. JB added lyrics to Cardboard Box, and to another instrumental titled \"Puppet Song\", subsequently renamed Pigeons. Cardboard Box was only played a handful of times before being dropped from the repertoire. In the Fall, the band signed with Landslide Records and recorded their first album, Space Wrangler, at John Keane's Studio in Athens. Guests on the album included Sunny on percussion, David Blackmon on fiddle, Tim White on keyboards, and Alberto Salazarte (of Athens band White Buffalo) on percussion.\n\nIn June of 1988, the first known guest appearance of producer John Keane on stage with the band occurred. Usually playing pedal steel, Keane became another regular guest at special Panic shows.\n\nTheir debut LP, Space Wrangler, established a small fan base and inaugurated several years of constant touring before the band signed to Capricorn Records and released their major label debut, Widespread Panic in 1991. After appearing with the H.O.R.D.E. tours for a few years, the band became one of the most popular new jam bands that arose in the mid-1990s. Their popularity peaked in the late 1990s/early 2000s, as their concert draw benefited from Phish's temporary hiatus. They still have a large draw in the South, where they are most popular. \n\nPlaying as many as 250 shows a year, Panic built a large fan base. True road warriors, Widespread Panic ranked among the top 50 grossing touring acts for eight years running, even without substantial radio airplay, television exposure, or promotion at retail stores. The band holds sellout records at Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver (23 shows), Oak Mountain Amphitheatre near Birmingham, Ala. (17 shows), Philips Arena in Atlanta (11 shows), and UNO Lakefront Arena in New Orleans (18 shows). Not to mention 20 sellouts at San Francisco's Warfield Theatre, seven sellouts across the Bay at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, nine sellouts at Mud Island in Memphis, seven at Memphis' Mid-South Coliseum, and in October 2003 for the popular Halloween shows sold out two concerts at New York's famed Madison Square Garden. To celebrate the release of their first live album, Light Fuse, Get Away, Widespread Panic offered a free \"CD release party\" concert in the streets of hometown Athens. An estimated 100,000 fans descended on the town, transforming it into the largest CD release party in history.\n\nIn August 2002, founding guitarist Michael Houser lost his battle with pancreatic cancer. George McConnell, a long time friend of the band and former Beanland,a Mississippi roots band, member joined in Houser's wake. After Hermann had joined Panic in 1992, McConnell often sat in whenever Panic played in the south. Friends for the past 15 years, Panic and McConnell had often played on the same bill for nearly as long. That longstanding relationship made him the natural choice to continue on with Panic after Michael Houser's death from pancreatic cancer in August of that year. \"It's all about chemistry,\" Schools said. \"We've been friends for 15 years.\" At the end of the summer tour, Panic went back to the studio to record Ball, a testament that, as Houser wished, they would continue as a band.\n\nOn August 2, 2006, the band announced that George McConnell would no longer be playing with the band. John Keane, friend and co-producer of many of the bands albums, provided guitar support for the remainder of the tour, along with Sam Holt. Both had been featured contributors in Widespread Panic concerts since the beginning of the Summer 2006 tour. The following day, the band announced that guitarist Jimmy Herring, who had previously been a member of the 1990s band the Aquarium Rescue Unit and had toured with The Allman Brothers Band and members of The Grateful Dead, would join the band, beginning with the first show of the Fall 2006 tour at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York.\n\nThe band has sold over 3 million albums, and released a total of 15 CDs and five DVDs (including Live at Oak Mountain, which is certified Gold). \n\nIn June 2006, their 9th and most recent studio album, Earth to America, was released. Earth to America was recorded with Terry Manning in Nassau, Bahamas at the beautiful Compass Point Studios. \n\nIn late 2006, Fayetteville, NC native Jimmy Herring took over the reins of the lead guitarist in the band, kicking off their fall tour with three nights at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York.\n\nPanic’s 7th annual New Year’s shows on December 30 and 31 of 2007, marked their 15th and 16th sellout performance at Philips Arena.\n\nThe band released their 10th album, Free Somehow, on February 12, 2008. It, too, was recorded with producer Terry Manning at Compass Point Studios.\n\nFollowing the release of the new studio album, Widespread Panic began to release vintage concert performances from the Widespread Panic Archives. Carbondale 2000 was released on June 10, 2008, followed by Valdosta 1989 released on February 24, 2009, and Huntsville 1996 released on June 23, 2009. The band will continue to dig into their show archives, which encompasses the past 25 years, and release these shows as multi-track recordings.\n\nJune 27, 2008, marked the band's 32nd sold-out show at Red Rocks Amphitheater. This was more than any other band in the venue's history. Mayor John Hickenlooper proclaimed Friday, June 27 \"Widespread Panic Day\" in the City and County of Denver. The same year, Widespread Panic was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame on September 20.\n\nThe band continued to tour throughout the rest of 2008 and the spring of 2009. In the summer of 2009, Widespread Panic teamed up with fellow southern rockers, The Allman Brothers to do a summer and fall co-headlining tour.\n\nIn March 2010, it was announced that Widespread Panic would be releasing a new album entitled Dirty Side Down on May 25, 2010. The band is also releasing Live in the Classic City II, containing music from its 2000 shows.\n\nOn September 29, 2010, Widespread keyboardist Jojo Herman announced that the band would be going on hiatus in 2012. In an interview with the Vanderbilt Hustler, Herman explained, \"Next year will be our 25th anniversary. After that, we're probably going to call it (quits) for awhile. So we're looking forward to next year and going out on a high note.\" \n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Widespread+Panic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Widespread Panic is a rock band which formed in Athens, Georgia, United States in 1986. The band currently consists of John Bell (vocals, guitar), Jimmy Herirng (guitar), Dave Schools (bass), John \"JoJo\" Hermann (keyboards), Domingo \"Sunny\" Ortiz (percussion) and Todd Nance (drums). The band has previously included Michael Houser (guitar) and George McConnell (guitar) and have released 11 albums.\n\nMichael Houser and John Bell ('JB') met at the University of Georgia at Athens between 1982 and 1984, and began playing music together around town as a duet. JB played solo shows as well. In the Fall of 1984, David Schools saw JB play a solo show at Abbots in Athens. Dave and JB were introduced by a mutual friend. Shortly thereafter, JB & Mike recruited Dave to play bass with them, and from Mike's nickname (\"Panic\"), the band name Widespread Panic was chosen. On February 24, 1985 the band played their first performance as Widespread Panic at the A-Frame house on Weymanda Court in Athens. Mike, JB, & Dave performed around Athens as a trio, occasionally utilizing local drummers. While their shows consisted primarily of cover tunes (by the likes of The Grateful Dead, Van Morrison, Bob Marley, and Traffic, among others), their repertoire did include a handful of original songs: Sleepy Monkey (the band's first original composition), Chilly Water, Space Wrangler, and Coconut (written by JB before joining the band).

    "headlinerBio": "Casting Crowns is a Christian band that employs a soft rock music style. The band was created by youth pastor Mark Hall who also serves as a lead vocalist. The band previously served and performed in a youth group in Atlanta.\n\nDiscovered by, among others, contemporary Christian music legend Steven Curtis Chapman, Casting Crowns got a recording contract and vaulted to popularity in 2003 with songs such as If We Are the Body and Who Am I. The Until The Whole World Hears Songfacts reports that Casting Crown's 2009 Until The Whole World Hears album  recorded 167,000 sales in its first week, the largest selling debut week sales figures by a Christian artist in Nielsen Soundscan history. \n\nOver the past eight years, Atlanta based Casting Crowns has consistently delivered music that points believers back to what truly matters. \n\nSince its launch in 2003 the band has garnered 14 GMA Dove Awards, three GRAMMY Awards and an American Music Award. In addition, the band has seen three RIAA Platinum Albums (Casting Crowns, Lifesong, Altar and The Door), two RIAA Platinum DVDs (Live From Atlanta and Lifesong Live), two RIAA Gold Albums (Until the Whole World Hears, Peace on Earth) and two Gold DVDs (Altar and The Door Live and Until The Whole World Hears Live). Casting Crowns has sold more than 8.2 million albums to date (according to Nielsen SoundScan) and has been named Billboard magazine’s top-selling Christian act for the past four years. \n\nThe band recently celebrated its first RIAA certified Gold single, “Who Am I,” from its 2003 self-titled debut. The song, selling more than 500,000 copies, is one of only 12 Christian tracks ever to secure Gold status. \n\nCasting Crowns has always worked its tour schedule around church responsibilities and has still managed to touch audiences around the world with its live performances. It’s 2009-2011 “Until The Whole World Hears” world tour placed the band in front nearly 1 million fans in more than 175 cities around the world including performances for U. S. troops in Kuwait and Qatar. The band also performed twice in North Korea in partnership with Global Resource Services.\n\nAlongside the 2011 feature film, Courageous, Casting Crowns wrote a song by the same name which was also featured on their album Come to the Well released the same year. The album's second single, \n\"Jesus, Friend of Sinners\" was not released until February of 2012. In September 2013, the band released \"All You've Ever Wanted\", the first single from Thrive which was released on January 28, 2014 and charted No. 6 in Billboard‍ '​s Top 200 in its first week. An accompanying book, written by Mark Hall, was released and explains the walk of a child of God and how we should \"dig deep and reach out\".\n\nIn early 2015 Casting Crowns released the hymn-album Glorious Day - Hymns of Faith, including Casting Crowns' Until the Whole World Hears singles \"Glorious Day (Living He Loved Me)\" and \"Blessed Redeemer\", an acoustic versions of \"If We Are the Body\" and \"Praise You In This Storm\" as well as eight hymns.\n\nIn addition to a busy touring, recording and writing life, four of the members of Casting Crowns serve as ministers to their home church, Eagle's Landing First Baptist Church in McDonough, Georgia. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Casting+Crowns\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "A few weeks back, we shared “Superfriends,” a release from a then mysterious artist either named “Z” or “user601586061.” Less than 24 hours after the song hit the Internet, a Do Androids Dance? reader did some NSA-caliber snooping to discover that the man behind “Superfriends” and the infectious “Moves Like Ms. Jackson” was actually Steven Zhu, a producer who had previously released music under the name ZHU.\n\n\"Many are wondering why I chose to release my music anonymously. I am my own ghostwriter. As a society, we become more attached to the creator than to the creation. Music is faceless. My music is for a new generation—one in which people appreciate art for its intrinsic value—Generation WHY.\"\n\n–ZHU, on his decision to maintain anonymity\n\nNow fully in the sun, ZHU returns with new single “Faded.” Though the weekend is almost behind us, “Faded” is yet another perfect soundtrack for late night mischief in the re-emergent producer’s catalog. It features the same infectious synth work and affected falsetto vocals that made both “Moves Like Ms. Jackson” and “Superfriends” such pleasant surprises. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/ZHU\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "1) \"A show with The Floozies is like a Lewis and Clark expedition through all things funky, except instead of Lewis and Clark you have brothers Matt and Mark Hill. Their \"funk for aliens\" will take you on a journey through classic funk, hip-hop, dub, disco, electronica, and afrobeat with hints of jazz and even film scores along the way. Since forming in January of 2008, this duo has gone from rocking local house parties to touring the country and performing alongside their musical heroes. And with nothing pre-recorded and nothing sampled, every show is a completely unique experience as they reach for new levels of improvisation. While The Floozies are certainly eclectic, one thing that can be counted on is that every show is a party. With lasers. And aliens. Their album, \"Live: Volume 1,\" is a testament to their unique musical approach. It contains 21 tracks from shows all over the country and is a free download from www.flooziesduo.com So come cleanse yourself in the waters of their synth-hop-electro travelling funk circus and be awakened by music that is truly created in the moment.\" [[[http://www.flooziesduo.com]]]\n\n2) THE pop-garage-rock band from So(u)lingen Rock City. www.thefloozies.de\n\n3) A female trio from East Anglia, England. www.myspace.com/theflooziesmusic <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Floozies\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band's music covers a variety of genres, including blues rock, psychedelic rock, folk rock, soul, and Southern rock. \n   Currently, the group comprises singer and harmonica player John Popper, guitarist Chan Kinchla, drummer Brendan Hill, bassist Tad Kinchla and keyboardist Ben Wilson. Tad Kinchla and Ben Wilson joined the band following the death of original bassist Bobby Sheehan in 1999.\n   While Blues Traveler is best known among fans for their improvisational live shows, the general public is most familiar with the group from their Top 40 singles \"Run-Around\" and \"Hook\".

    "headlinerBio": "Casting Crowns is a Christian band that employs a soft rock music style. The band was created by youth pastor Mark Hall who also serves as a lead vocalist. The band previously served and performed in a youth group in Atlanta.\n\nDiscovered by, among others, contemporary Christian music legend Steven Curtis Chapman, Casting Crowns got a recording contract and vaulted to popularity in 2003 with songs such as If We Are the Body and Who Am I. The Until The Whole World Hears Songfacts reports that Casting Crown's 2009 Until The Whole World Hears album  recorded 167,000 sales in its first week, the largest selling debut week sales figures by a Christian artist in Nielsen Soundscan history. \n\nOver the past eight years, Atlanta based Casting Crowns has consistently delivered music that points believers back to what truly matters. \n\nSince its launch in 2003 the band has garnered 14 GMA Dove Awards, three GRAMMY Awards and an American Music Award. In addition, the band has seen three RIAA Platinum Albums (Casting Crowns, Lifesong, Altar and The Door), two RIAA Platinum DVDs (Live From Atlanta and Lifesong Live), two RIAA Gold Albums (Until the Whole World Hears, Peace on Earth) and two Gold DVDs (Altar and The Door Live and Until The Whole World Hears Live). Casting Crowns has sold more than 8.2 million albums to date (according to Nielsen SoundScan) and has been named Billboard magazine’s top-selling Christian act for the past four years. \n\nThe band recently celebrated its first RIAA certified Gold single, “Who Am I,” from its 2003 self-titled debut. The song, selling more than 500,000 copies, is one of only 12 Christian tracks ever to secure Gold status. \n\nCasting Crowns has always worked its tour schedule around church responsibilities and has still managed to touch audiences around the world with its live performances. It’s 2009-2011 “Until The Whole World Hears” world tour placed the band in front nearly 1 million fans in more than 175 cities around the world including performances for U. S. troops in Kuwait and Qatar. The band also performed twice in North Korea in partnership with Global Resource Services.\n\nAlongside the 2011 feature film, Courageous, Casting Crowns wrote a song by the same name which was also featured on their album Come to the Well released the same year. The album's second single, \n\"Jesus, Friend of Sinners\" was not released until February of 2012. In September 2013, the band released \"All You've Ever Wanted\", the first single from Thrive which was released on January 28, 2014 and charted No. 6 in Billboard‍ '​s Top 200 in its first week. An accompanying book, written by Mark Hall, was released and explains the walk of a child of God and how we should \"dig deep and reach out\".\n\nIn early 2015 Casting Crowns released the hymn-album Glorious Day - Hymns of Faith, including Casting Crowns' Until the Whole World Hears singles \"Glorious Day (Living He Loved Me)\" and \"Blessed Redeemer\", an acoustic versions of \"If We Are the Body\" and \"Praise You In This Storm\" as well as eight hymns.\n\nIn addition to a busy touring, recording and writing life, four of the members of Casting Crowns serve as ministers to their home church, Eagle's Landing First Baptist Church in McDonough, Georgia. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Casting+Crowns\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Emerging onto the Southern California music scene with a sound as original as the band members themselves, the Dirty Heads’ blend of hip-hop and classic reggae rips through the sonic surf with bold beats, fun rhythms and the relaxed vibe of feel-good lyrics.\n\nRooted in the Orange County community of Huntington Beach, California, founding band members Jared Watson and guitarist / vocalist Dustin Bushnell met in 1996 while in high school, embarking on a friendship based on music, as well as their shared passion for surfing, skating and the endless party of the laid-back SoCal lifestyle.\n\nEarly on, they spent many late nights jamming in Bushnell’s soundproof garage with a four-track recorder, writing unique acoustic hip-hop songs that featured reggae inflections. Inspired by the rock and reggae sounds of Bob Marley, Sublime, 311 and The Beastie Boys, the band’s music evolved into their distinct Dirty Heads style.\n\nTo complete the Dirty Heads’ sound, the duo added percussionist Jon Olazabal and drummer Matt Ochoa, both talented, experienced musicians. With a set of solid material, the Dirty Heads were further motivated to take their craft to the next level, and they began building a loyal fan base throughout the west coast, while performing acoustically at local bars and small music venues. As they started playing in neighboring Los Angeles, the band found it necessary to charter party buses so their fans could make the 30-mile trek to their shows.\n\nConnecting with sought-after producers Steve Fox and Stan Frazier (Sugar Ray / Ashlee Simpson) the band worked long hours to polish their material and further develop their style. The Dirty Heads also recruited mixing engineer Mario Caldato Jr., best known for his work with the Beastie Boys, to add the finishing touches and create just the right blend.\n\nThe band’s highly-anticipated first full-length album is entitled, Any Port in the Storm (Released on EMG through Fontana, a division of Universal Music Group Distribution - September 2008). This debut features 14 tracks that are reminiscent of the upbeat, sun-soaked Southern California party energy. The first single is the optimistic, “Stand Tall.”\n\nAny Port in the Storm also features one of the final recordings of the late music industry icon Billy Preston. Frequently referred to as “The Fifth Beatle,” Preston played on three tracks, including “Stand Tall,” “Chelsea,” and “Driftin.’ ” Other special guests on the album are drummer Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle, Sting, The Vandals), and veteran session percussionist Alex Acuna, whose A-list musician resume includes Peter Gabriel, Johnny Clegg, and Jackson Browne, to name only a few.\n\nRecently, the band’s music has been attracting attention throughout the world of entertainment. Their songs have been featured in the movie and soundtrack for Surf’s Up (Sony 2007); and the television drama, Shark staring James Woods (CBS 2007. Actor Matthew McConaughey selected the band’s music to be in his upcoming film, Surfer Dude. In addition, the Dirty Heads can be heard in Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam video game (Activision 2007), and several other music compilations and surf/skate videos. On the marketing side, the Dirty Heads have also been included in campaigns for Etnies Jeans and Vestal Watches.\n\nDirty Heads vocalist Jared Watson sums up their fun, uncomplicated style, “We want to be positive and entertain,” he says. “We just want to make you feel good.”\n\nAnd who can’t dig that?\n\nwww.dirtyheads.com\nwww.myspace.com/dirtyheads <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dirty+Heads\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Cypress Hill is an American hip-hop group from South Gate, California. Cypress Hill was the first latino group to have platinum and multi-platinum albums and one of the first rap groups to gain a following with fans of hard rock and metal. The band was originally called DVX, but the name was changed after Mellow Man Ace left in 1988.\n\nTheir first album, which was self-titled, was released in August 1991. Its single was \"Phuncky Feel One\", but it was the B-side \"How I Could Just Kill A Man\" (formerly \"Trigga Happy Nigga\") that attracted more airplay on urban radio and college radio. Based on the success of the single and other tracks such as bilingual track \"Latin Lingo\" and X-rated Spanish track \"Tres Equis\", the album sold two million copies in the US alone. Subsequently, DJ Muggs produced the first House of Pain album, then worked on other projects like Funkdoobiest. The band made their first appearance at Lollapalooza on the side stage in 1992.\n\nBlack Sunday, the group's second album, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1993, recording the highest Soundscan for a rap group up until that time. Also with their debut still on the charts they became the first rap artists to have 2 albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 at the same time. With \"Insane in the Brain\" becoming a crossover hit, the album went triple platinum in the U.S. and sold about 3.25 million copies.\n\nCypress Hill was banned from Saturday Night Live after Muggs smoked cannabis on-air and the band trashed their instruments while playing their second single \"I Ain't Goin' Out Like That\". The band headlined the \"Soul Assassins\" tour with House of Pain and Funkdoobiest as support, then performed on a college tour with Rage Against the Machine and Seven Year Bitch. In 1993, Cypress Hill also had two tracks on the Judgment Night soundtrack, teamed up with Pearl Jam and Sonic Youth.\n\nThe band played at the 1994 Woodstock Festival introducing their new member Eric Bobo, formerly a percussionist with the Beastie Boys. Bobo is the son of salsa musician Willie Bobo. Rolling Stone magazine named the band as the best rap group in their music awards voted by critics and readers. Cypress Hill played at Lollapalooza for two successive years, topping the bill in 1995. They appeared on the The Simpsons episode \"Homerpalooza\".\n\nTheir third album Cypress Hill III: Temples of Boom was released in 1995 selling 1.5 million copies and reaching number 3 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the hit single \"Throw Your Set in the Air\". Cypress Hill also contributed a track \"I Wanna Get High\" to the High Times sponsored Hempilation album to support NORML.\n\n\nFeud With Ice Cube\n\nIce Cube asked to put \"Throw Your Set in the Air\" on his Friday soundtrack, but B-Real refused, prompting Cube to record a new song \"Friday\" with a similar chorus; Cypress Hill responded with the track \"No Rest For The Wicked.\" Westside Connection replied with the diss track \"King Of The Hill\" and \"Cross Em Out & Put a K\", to which Cypress Hill replied with \"Ice Cube Killa,\" which uses the same beat as \"King Of The Hill\" and disses Ice Cube and Mack 10. \"Ice Cube Killa\" has never been released officially. In 1997 B-Real of Cypress Hill and Ice Cube were invited to a late night talk show in order to reconcile their differences for the benefit of the hip hop community, and the feud thus ended. Cube And B-Real would work together later that year as guest features on the track \"Men of Steel\" for the soundtrack of Shaquille O'Neal's film Steel. B-Real and Cube did even feature as guests in Warren G's single \"Get U Down\" which also featured Snoop Dogg.\n\n\nContinued career\n\nSen Dog took a break from the band to form a Los Angeles based punk-rap band SX-10. Meanwhile in 1996, Cypress Hill appeared on the first 'Smokin' Grooves' tour, featuring Ziggy Marley, The Fugees, Busta Rhymes and A Tribe Called Quest. The band also released a nine track EP Unreleased and Revamped with rare mixes. In 1997, band members focused on their solo careers. Muggs released Muggs Presents ... the Soul Assassins featuring contributions from Wu-Tang Clan members, Dr. Dre, KRS-One, Wyclef Jean and Mobb Deep. B-Real appeared with Busta Rhymes, Coolio, LL Cool J and Method Man on \"Hit Em High\" from the multi-platinum Space Jam Soundtrack. He also appeared with RBX, Nas and KRS-One on \"East Coast Killer, West Coast Killer\" on Dr. Dre's Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath album, and released an album entitled \"The Psycho Realm\" from his side project of the same name. Though the focus that year was not on Cypress Hill, the band played Smokin' Grooves with George Clinton and Erykah Badu.\n\nCypress Hill released IV in 1998 which went gold in the U.S., even though the reviews were somewhat negative,[citation needed] on the backs of hit singles \"Tequila Sunrise\" and another tribute to smoking cannabis \"Dr. Greenthumb.\" Sen Dog also released the Get Wood sampler as part of SX-10 on the label Flip. In 1999, Cypress Hill helped with the PC crime/very mature video game Kingpin: Life of Crime. Three of their songs from the 1998 IV album were in the game ( \"16 Men Till There's No Men Left\", \"Checkmate\" and \"Lightning Strikes\"). B-Real also did some of the voices of the people in the game. Also in 1999, the band released a greatest-hits album in Spanish, Los grandes éxitos en español. Cypress Hill then fused genres with their two-disc release, Skull & Bones, in 2000. The first disc, \"Skull\" was comprised of rap tracks while \"Bones\" explored further the group's forays into rock. The album reached the Top 5 on the Billboard 200 and number 3 in Canada. The first single was \"Rock Superstar\" for rock radio and \"Rap Superstar\" for urban radio. The band also released Live at the Fillmore, a concert disc recorded at the Fillmore (in San Fransico) in 2000. Cypress Hill continued their experimentation with rock on the Stoned Raiders album in 2001. However, its sales were a disappointment, as the disc did not even reach the top 50 of the U.S. album charts. In 2001, the group appeared in the film How High.\n\nCypress Hill recorded \"Just Another Victim\" for the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as a theme song for Tazz. At the time, WWE was using original music for almost all of the wrestlers, so this was an unusual step for the company to take, but it remains one of the more memorable songs to emerge from the wrestling organization. The band released Till Death Do Us Part on March 23, 2004. The album saw the band experiment with reggae especially on the lead single \"What's Your Number\". The track features Tim Armstrong of Rancid on guitar and Rob Aston of The Transplants on backup vocals. It is based on the classic song \"Guns of Brixton\" on The Clash's London Calling and has proven to be a success on the modern rock charts. However, the album represented a further departure from the signature sound of their first four albums. The album also features appearances by Damian Marley, son of Bob Marley, Prodigy and Twin of Mobb Deep and producer the Alchemist.\n\nIn 2004, the song How I Could Just Kill A Man was included in the popular videogame Grand Theft Auto San Andreas created by Rockstar Games, playing on West Coast hip hop radio station Radio Los Santos. In December of 2005 a best of compilation album titled Greatest Hits From the Bong was released including 9 hits from previous albums and 2 new tracks. The group's next album was tentatively scheduled for an early 2007 release. In the summer of 2006, B-Real appeared on Snoop Dogg's single \"Vato\". Pharrell Williams produced the track, and originally sang the hook, but because of the video idea, B-Real was asked to sing the hook. Sen Dog is now currently touring with the Kottonmouth Kings, Kingspade and Dogboy on the Joint is on Fire Tour\n\nIn 2007 Cypress Hill toured with their full line up as a part of the Rock the Bells tour, held by Guerilla Union, and headlined with Public Enemy, Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, and a reunited Rage Against the Machine. Other acts included Immortal Technique, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, The Roots, EPMD, Pharoae Monch, Jedi Mind Tricks, Erykah Badu, MF Doom, Sage Francis, Brother Ali, The Coup, Blue Print, Lucky I Am, Living Legends, Felt, Cage, Mr. Lif, Grouch & Eligh, and Hangar 18.\n\n\nDeparture from Sony\n\nHaving fulfilled their contractual obligations with Sony Music, Cypress Hill will release an as-yet untitled album through a different record label in 2008.\nRecently, it was announced that Cypress Hill will be members of the Kannabis Kartel along with the Kottonmouth Kings and Potluck. Their album will be released on Suburban Noize Records.\n\n\nSTYLE\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nProduction\n\nOne of the band's most striking aspects is B-Real's exaggeratedly high-pitched nasal vocals, which fits and emphasizes the lyrics' concentration on parodied gangster stories.\n\nSen Dog's lyrics are progressively more violent and tend to involve fewer rhyme schemes compared with B-Real's. In addition, as the style is today, some words are emphasized by adding a background voice to say them, however, Sen Dog's emphases are always more prominent, mostly shouted alongside with the rapping.\n\nThe sound and groove of their music, produced by Muggs, is also notable for its influence and stoned aesthetic; with its bass-heavy rhythms and odd sample loops (\"Insane in the Brain\" is notable for having a horse neigh looped in its chorus), it carries a psychedelic value, which lessened in the later albums.\n\nThe band is also known for involving rock instruments in their songs. This has caused the band to sometimes be classified as a rapcore group. In IV, there is Lightning Strikes which doesn't truly use electric guitars, but a synthesized version of it. Skull & Bones has an entire disc using such instruments, labeled Bones. As for their later works, their involvement in rock ended with the album Stoned Raiders (the tracks Trouble (also the first single of the album), Amplified and Catastrophe being the songs).\n\nThe band's music is constantly subject to change; while the first album follows a more minimalistic and funky sound, Black Sunday, the successor, has a slightly darker side to it. III (Temples of Boom) and IV are mostly influenced by psychedelic music. The band abandoned that on Skull & Bones and got closer to the modern rap as it is today. Stoned Raiders has a more authentic sound than the rest, and Till Death Do Us Part carries reggae influences.\n\nThe band is also known to involve horns in their songs, and often have guitar and horns together in the instrumentals. What's Your Number?, Trouble, Tequila Sunrise, and (Rock) Superstar have become some of the bands most popular songs featuring these elements. Cypress Hill's experimenting in different genres of music even includes reggaeton in their track \"Latin Thugs\" which features Tego Calderon.\n\nSome fans feel that the band has drifted somewhat from the values of their earlier albums. For example in \"Strictly Hip Hop\" from Temples of Boom, the band complain about hip hop artists who have an album of hardcore tracks but have one or two pop songs which just so happen to be the singles. Cypress have arguably fallen into this trap with the single \"What's You Number?\"\n\nThe sound contribitions of DJ Muggs seems to be clearly influenced by marijuana consumption. Since one of the effects of a cannabis high is an altered audio sensual perception, the often slow paced and deep bass can be better appreciated. Furthermore, psychedelic sequences underly some parts of certain tracks such as \"I Wanna Get High\" for example. This is an interesting feature of their music, that had also been used before, especially during the 60's and 70's (e.g. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles).\n\n\nLyrics\n\nThe lyrics of tracks like \"How I Could Just Kill A Man\" offer an insight into the cultural expression of social stratification in L.A. at that point in history. Many other songs have cited topics such as police brutality, racial profiling, gang violence and anecdotes about invasion of privacy by police.\n\nFurthermore the celebration of marijuana consumption is what they are often associated with in songs like \"I Wanna Get High\", \"Stoned Is The Way Of The Walk\" or \"Hits From The Bong\", the themes of recreational use of marijuana are prevalent.\n\nMany of their songs also protest the current marijuana laws and voice their opinions on the hypocrisy of drug enforcement institutions.\n\nTheir lyrics often reflect the hip hop culture of Los Angeles in their earlier work such as their self-titled album and Black Sunday, which were very influential not only to Latino hip hop of the time but to many other hip hop groups around the world as well.\n\nThroughout their career they have commonly incorporated Spanish into their lyrics as well as slang used by some Latinos in Los Angeles on songs like \"Latin Lingo\". Their album \"Los Grandes Exitos En Espanol\" features Spanish translations of many of their hit songs.\n\nYears active 1987 -  present.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Modest Mouse is an alternative rock band which formed in 1993 in Issaquah, Washington, United States. The band's original lineup consisted of guitarist Isaac Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green and bassist Eric Judy. Since being signed to Sony's Epic Records in 2000, Modest Mouse has attained significant popular success with songs such as \"Float On\" and \"Dashboard.\"\n\nThe band's current configuration is Isaac Brock (vocals, guitar), Tom Peloso (strings, horns, bass, keyboards), Jim Fairchild (guitar), Eric Judy (bass), Jeremiah Green (drums) and Joe Plummer (drums). Plummer has recently become the new drummer for The Shins.\n\nBrock came up with the name \"Modest Mouse\" when he read the Virginia Woolf stream of consciousness essay The Mark On the Wall in which the author described the working middle class as \"modest mouse-coloured people\"\n\nBrock frequently moved around with his mother when he was a child. Around this time, his mother left his father for his father's brother (Brock's uncle). Brock's mother's house flooded and forced them to move into his mother's new husband's trailer, but there was no room for Brock. Brock stayed behind, living in the second story of the flooded house, until he was eventually evicted by police. He then moved into a shed next to his mother's house and it is said this is where Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green and bassist Eric Judy first began playing music.\n\nIn 1994, the band recorded their debut EP, Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?, at Calvin Johnson's Dub Narcotic Studios, which was then released on Calvin's record label K Records. Then followed a single with Sub Pop that was recorded by producer Steve Wold at Moon Studios. Wold, who in the mid-2000's would begin to perform under the name Seasick Steve, would also perform on the band's albums, but was never an official member of the band. After moving to Up Records Modest Mouse put out several releases recorded at Moon Studios, including 1996's This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About. This double LP was produced and recorded by Steve Wold. The next offering on UP was Interstate 8; also produced by Steve Wold. 1997's The Lonesome Crowded West, (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) turned out to be the band's breakthrough album. The Lonesome Crowded West gained the band a cult following and is now widely considered by many critics to be one of the defining albums of mid-90s indie rock.\n\nIn 2000, Modest Mouse released The Moon And Antarctica, their first album on a major label (Epic Records). The band enjoyed some success on alternative radio with the singles \"3rd Planet\" and \"Gravity Rides Everything.\" Lead singer Isaac Brock has since put out an album with his side project Ugly Casanova on Sub Pop Records. \n\nIn 2003, drummer Jeremiah Green quit the band; the official word was that he was quitting to work with his side project, Vells. He was replaced with two members, drummer Benjamin Weikel (who also drummed for The Helio Sequence) and guitarist Dann Gallucci (Murder City Devils).  Weikel being new to the band and Gallucci returning to the band for the first time since This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About. On April 6, 2004, Modest Mouse released the platinum-selling Good News For People Who Love Bad News, which scored two hits with \"Float On\" and \"Ocean Breathes Salty\". In 2004 Jeremiah Green returned to the band, and Benjamin Weikel now drums exclusively for The Helio Sequence. Dann Gallucci left the band in August, and they toured with Hutch Harris of The Thermals during the fall of 2004.\n\nModest Mouse was mentioned by name in the 2005 Supreme Court decision in the case of MGM v. Grokster. Justice Souter wrote that on the Grokster P2P network, \"Users seeking Top 40 songs, for example, or the latest release by Modest Mouse, are certain to be far more numerous than those seeking a free Decameron, and Grokster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars.\"\n\nIn 2005, multi-instrumentalist Tom Peloso, who already played various instruments on Good News For People Who Love Bad News, officially joined the band. In 2006,  Johnny Marr, former guitarist for The Smiths, became an official member of the band.\n\nOn March 20, 2007, the band released their fifth album, We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank. Four singles were released from the album: \"Dashboard\", \"Missed the Boat\", \"We've Got Everything\" and \"Little Motel\". The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 album chart. James Mercer of The Shins provides backing vocals on three songs.\n\nIn 2009, they released No One's First And You're Next, an EP of unreleased songs from around the time Good News and We Were Dead were recorded, and two songs that had already been released, \"I've Got It All (Most)\" and \"King Rat\". The video for King Rat was directed by late actor Heath Ledger.\n\nIn 2009, Johnny Marr left the band and was replaced by Jim Fairchild, formerly of Grandaddy. The band performed at several festivals throughout 2009 and 2010, including the main stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2010. \n\nAfter an 8 year wait, the band's latest full-length is \"Strangers To Ourselves\", released March 17th, 2015- two weeks after the original release date, March 3rd, 2015. The album art is an aerial photo of an RV resort located in Mesa, Arizona. Five singles were released before the album, \"Lampshades on Fire\", \"Coyotes\", \"The Ground Walks, with Time in a Box\", \"The Best Room\", and \"Of Course we Know\".  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Modest+Mouse\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Yo-Yo Ma is a world-famous Chinese-American cellist. He is considered one of the best cellists in the world and has made over 50 albums.\n\nHe was born to Chinese parents living in Paris. He began to study the cello with his father at age 4 and soon came with his family to New York, where he spent most of his formative years. Later, his principal teacher was Leonard Rose at the Juilliard School. He sought out a traditional liberal arts education to expand upon his conservatory training, graduating from Harvard University in 1976.\n\nYo-Yo Ma has been called \"the most omnivorous of all cellists\" by critics and indeed possesses a far more eclectic repertoire than typical for a classical player. He has performed and recorded Baroque pieces on period instruments, American bluegrass music, traditional Chinese melodies, the Argentinian tangos of Astor Piazzolla, Brazilian music, the soundtrack to the film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and Philip Glass's minimalist score of Naqoyqatsi in addition to numerous recordings of the standard classical repertoire. His latest CD is a collaboration with other musicians for the Memoirs of a Geisha soundtrack.\n\nYo-Yo Ma's main performance instrument is a very fine 1733 Montagnana cello. He also plays the Davidoff Stradivarius from 1712, which was also played by Jacqueline du Pre. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Yo-Yo+Ma\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Cameron Jibril Thomaz (born September 8, 1987 in Minot, North Dakota), better known by his stage name Wiz Khalifa, is an American rapper based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, signed to Rostrum Records. According to the Black and Yellow Songfacts, his stage name is derived from khalifa, an Arabic word meaning \"successor\", and wisdom. His nickname growing up was \"Wizard\" which was shortened to Wiz when Khalifa was fifteen.\n\nIn 2005 he released his first official mixtape, Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania, and later in 2006 he released his first full length street album entitled Show and Prove. Since then he has released a further six mixtapes and a collaboration mixtape titled How Fly with friend Curren$y. He released his debut album, Deal or No Deal, in November of 2009, it reached #1 on the iTunes hip hop chart, and then reached the top ten on iTunes' overall album chart the week it was released. Previously signed to Warner Bros. Records, he left the label in July 2009 after numerous delays in releasing his planned debut album for the label, First Flight. Khalifa stated to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that, \"I learned a lot during my time there and matured as an artist during the process. I'm happy to be moving on with all of my material and having the chance to be in control of my next moves\".He is also the founder of the rap crew Taylor Gang, which includes friends Kev Tha Hustler, Ekko, Smallz Money and Gene Stovall. They derived the name from the fact they always used to wear Chuck Taylor shoes.\n\nKhalifa was born on September 8, 1987 in Minot, North Dakota to a mother and a father serving in the military. The family moved to Pittsburgh when Khalifa was the age of two. His parents' military service caused the family to move on a regular basis. \nOver the next thirteen years, he would move between Pittsburgh and South Carolina, Georgia, Oklahoma, Germany, Japan, and England as his parents were reassigned to different posts. In October of 1990 Wiz was separated from his mother,who left him in the hands of her sister while she served in Operation Desert Storm.\n\nDuring his travels, Wiz was forced to mature quicker than his peers. He was constantly faced with new surroundings, new schools, and new sets of friends, and he found it difficult to become attached to anyone outside his family roots. This nomadic life gave Wiz an opportunity, though, to broaden his mind and offered him many experiences from which to draw inspiration. He began to perceive the world differently than most kids, and he would write his thoughts down every day.These thoughts would become the foundation for his future recordings.\n\nBy the age of 14, with a few songs under his belt, Wiz was already drawing comparisons with his commanding voice and witty wordplay. While he has been influenced by artists such as Jay-Z, Camron, and the Notorious B.I.G., Wiz was determined to create his own identity that would, one day, be loved and revered by fans.\n\nReady to take the next step, Wiz began his search for a recording studio to record new songs. He found one, ID LABS, where owner Eric Dan immediately recognized Wiz's talents. Along with Chad Glick of ID Management, they began to network Wiz to another Pittsburgh native, Benjy Grinberg of Rostrum Records. Benjy realized the raw talent that Wiz possessed, and immediately brought him into the Rostrum family in 2002.\n\nSoon after, Wiz Khalifa began his ascent into the music scene in the Pittsburgh area. He has been hailed by the award winning Pittsburgh Post-Gazette pop music critic, Ed Masley, as having “the skills, the looks, the confidence, the drive, and the charisma for the job.” The New Pittsburgh Courier says, “The combination of a young, charismatic M.C. with a slew of stop-and-rewind rhymes together with a local independent label with major industry connections has set the stage for a hip-hop artist representing Pittsburgh to reach superstar status for the first time ever.\n\nIn 2010, with the success of Kush and Orange Juice still present, Wiz Khalifa signed with Atlantic Records. Wiz's style along with his production team, Johnny Juliano, Sledgren, and E. Dan make this a winning combination for success. \n\nHe is also well known for his debut single for Atlantic, \"Black and Yellow\", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. His debut album for the label, Rolling Papers, was released on March 29, 2011. He followed that album with O.N.I.F.C. (abbreviated for mainstream markets from \"Only Nigga In First Class\") on December 4, 2012 which was backed by the singles \"Work Hard, Play Hard\" and \"Remember You\". O.N.I.F.C. debuted at number two with 131,000 in first week sales.\n\nIn April 2013, Khalifa revealed that after having his son he decided to work on a new album that he was planning to release in 2013. On April 17, 2013, Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y announced that they will drop their collaboration EP Live in Concert on April 20, 2013. The EP featured seven new songs. On June 24, 2013, he announced that his fifth studio album would be titled Blacc Hollywood and would be released in 2013. On September 3, 2013, Khalifa revealed he had recorded songs with Miley Cyrus, Adele and Juicy J for Blacc Hollywood. In October 2013, Mannie Fresh confirmed that he provided production for the album. On February 11, 2014, Khalifa released Blacc Hollywood's first single titled \"We Dem Boyz\". The album was then supported by the singles \"KK\", \"You and Your Friends\", \"Stayin Out All Night\", \"Promises\" and \"So High\". \n\nKhalifa released an EP with TY Dolla $ign on March 31, 2015, entitled \"Talk About It In the Morning\". That same month, Wiz released the lead single for the film \"Furious 7\" called \"See You Again\" as a tribute to Paul Walker. The single has since gone on to global success. \"See You Again\" spent 12 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, tying for the longest-running rap number-one hit in the US. \n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Wiz+Khalifa\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Man centered on frontman John Gourley’s abstract musical approach and corresponding upbringing.  He was raised in a sort of technological isolation: his log cabin home in the winter wasteland of the fringes of Wasilla, Alaska was powered by a generator and had no telephone. Both of his parents helped completely immerse him in the unique lifestyle that comes with a land of seasonal darkness and perpetual cold with their jobs as dog sled mushers. Gourley’s innate curiosity and individual spirit combined with a fascination with science fiction and experiences of homelessness create a distinctly transcendent sound that is always open to interpretation and change. \n\nThe band’s debut album, Waiter: “You Vultures!” was released by Fearless Records on January 24th, 2006.\n\nOn June 22, 2007 they released their second full length, Church Mouth.

The track, \"Sumatran Tiger\" does not officially exist digitally, and the copies were sent to \"400 carefully chosen influencers, among them actors, activists, musicians, conservationists, bloggers and journalists,\" and is, as the band claims, \"the first song meant to go extinct unless it's reproduced.\" The band encouraged fans to \"scour the Internet\" using the hashtags #EndangeredSong and #SumatranTiger to find recordings of the song.\n\nIn November 2014, Portugal.

The album's title was inspired by an original 1969 Woodstock music festival ticket stub owned by Gourley's father. It led Gourley to a realization that almost 50 years later, music has the same mission as then – \"to comment on societal and political unease.\" \"We worked with so many rad people on this album, but ended up with just the four of us in a basement at 4 a.m. trying to say something that mattered,\" said Gourley. \"Trying to write music that would help people feel they're not alone, even if they're angry or feeling lost.\" Woodstock was released on June 16, 2017. John Gourley and Zoe Manville married on New Year's Eve 2017. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Portugal.+The+Man\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His father worked in the coal industry and his mother is a nurse. He learned singing in church where he sang in the church choir. He started to play guitar and write songs when he was around 13.

Fellow country musicians Chris Stapleton and Loretta Lynn (Van Lear, KY) also hail from Paintsville.

In 2011, when he was 19, Childers released his first album, Bottles And Bibles. He has also released two EPs recorded in 2013 at Red Barn Radio, a radio show from Lexington.

    "headlinerBio": "San Francisco-based house producer Lane 8 (real name: Daniel Goldstein) made quite a splash when The Magician played his debut single, “Don’t Want You Back”, in the 23rd installment of the wildly popular Magic Tape series. The follow-up single, titled ‘Dusty’, surpassed all expectations, racking up diverse DJ support from the UK’s Jody Wisternoff and Kidnap Kid to California’s Viceroy and Geisha Twins.

    "headlinerBio": "Tipper is a mononym of UK breakbeat / nu skool breaks / trip-hop producer / DJ Dave Tipper.\n\nTipper's output includes strong hints of electro and idm. He is known for his interest in extreme bass frequencies, with his releases often including lengthy subbass test tones at the end. His ambient organic sounds blended with technologically borne beats and noises makes his music extremely psychedelic, this combined with exquisitely timed and cut scratching makes him one of the most complete electronic artists today, creating structures and textures that in some other contexts might be contrary and confusing, but fuse instead into a complex, harmonious and sometimes dark structure that continues to push the envelope of modern composition.\n\nTipper is widely respected as a Surround Sound composer[by whom?], releasing one of the first albums composed, produced, and intended for the DualDisc format, in addition to providing content for multichannel music industry leaders DTS, Inc.. His talents at sound design (his work is included in several of the major music making software programs[3]), and in digital audio mastering, are also in great demand. His catalogue has been consistently licensed for use as background in a variety of mainstream television programmes, and also featured in commercials and cable television projects.\n\nTipper was 'discovered' as a teenager DJing in a London nightclub by soon-to-be manager Richie Warren. Their earliest conversations centred on bass frequencies and rhythms underlying beats, and they began researching the science involved in creating the most effective dance music. Richie founded Fuel Records (UK), and Tipper released the first of several vinyl EP's in 1997.. Renault licensed one of these, Twister, for a European ad campaign. Soon thereafter, Sony UK signed Tipper to their fledgling dance music label, Higher Ground.\n\nHigher Ground\n\nIn the late 1990s Tipper completed numerous remix projects of his Higher Ground label mates, and released several singles, each highlighting his penchant for electronic dance music with extreme bass frequencies and intricate polyrhythms; this sound helped usher in a popular new music genre referred to as Nuskool Breakbeat, and Tipper is recognised as one of the pioneering producers of this movement. In 1999 Tipper released his first album, The Critical Path. It was not, however, the 'breakbeat' dance record that the label hoped for. Tipper's vision was decidedly more artistic than anticipated, confusing the label as to how to promote it, and disappointing sales led to an amicable parting of ways with Sony.\n\nThe Fuel years\n\nDuring the late 1990s while Tipper was busy in the studio, Richie Warren & Co conceptualised the Fuel Sound System. This consisted of 2 identical black 1970s Dodge Challengers, both fitted with 6 x18\" subwoofers (replacing where the back seats had previously been) and a Funktion-One mid/tops speaker unit, that could be raised out of the trunk on hydraulics with the flick of a switch from the driver's dashboard. These cars were able to run independently, without the need for an electrical generator, using 6 batteries charged via an alternator salvaged out of a lorry. With a totally discreet and fully mobile sound system, the Fuel crew, assuming the role of sonic pranksters, began a pilgrimage of sound that took them on tour to various music festivals, parties & spontaneous gatherings, setting them up outside events and garnering attention for the label and its artists. One of the 'urban myths' surrounding these appearances recounts the incident at the 1997 V Festival, when Richie Warren received complaints from The Prodigy's stage manager, because the band couldn't hear itself due to the excess volume.\n\nWith this activity as a backdrop, Tipper released his second album Holding Pattern in early 2001. Many of the individual tracks from this album found their way into DJ boxes internationally, and accordingly Tipper began touring extensively through Europe, the United States and Australia. Reflecting his travels was the DJ Mix album Sound Off which he completed for Fuel later the same year. Tipper focused on the music, and Richie promoted a lifestyle – taking the cars wherever possible to create a happening around both.\n\nMyUtopia\n\nWhile touring across the United States in 2003 with the Fuel Cars, Tipper began composing tracks for what would become his first album intended entirely as a surround sound listening experience. Surrounded was released in 2004 by fledgling 5.1 venture MyUtopia Recordings; eventually nominated as Best Album Intended for Surround Sound[8] this Downtempo album also marked a turn in Tipper's musical output away from the NuSkool genre which he was more widely associated with. It was during this period that digital music sales and/or reproduction usurped the music industry, and ultimately Fuel Records (UK) met its demise. As Tipper toured and performed his album in 5.1 wherever possible, Richie re-focused his talents towards advanced Auto parts, and Tipper set off on a non-stop touring schedule for two years, with London only a temporary base between tours. Constantly seen living out of his suitcase, and keeping his 'studio' in his backpack, earned him the temporary moniker The Global Nomad.\n\nLate 2004 saw his Surrounded album re-released as a DualDisc title, and this in turn led to the creation of his personal MP3 Surround Sound Player, by mp3 rights holders Fraunhofer Society. Regarded as one of the foremost composers in the multichannel realm, Tipper continues to provide content for a number of companies who use his highly detailed productions to demonstrate their own advanced technologies.\n\nTippermusic\n\n2005 witnessed the establishment of his own imprint Tippermusic, and he embraced the digital music revolution for the freedom it gave musicians to finally determine their own path. No longer constrained by label requirements, Tipper set about releasing his music independently, mostly via online stores. Some investment was made in CDs and Vinyl, but ultimately online sales figures showed their declining relevance for his style of output.\n\nTipper began releasing albums at an accelerated rate. First off was the ground breaking Tip Hop, which focused on merging Hip Hop production with electronic trickery and helped usher in a new genre referred to as Glitch Hop. He immediately followed up with Relish The Trough, which was material consisting of compositions from his catalogue used primarily for his performances on tour. Both albums found favour in Hollywood, and a number of tracks were used as background in prime time television shows.\n\nHis second full downtempo release The Seamless Unspeakable Something debuted in 2006, with Tipper in full guise as an electronica trip hop wizard; tracks from this album also found favour as background music on TV. In 2007 he digitally re-mastered his old vinyl catalogue and quietly released Fuel Years and Higher Ground to the delight of DJ's globally who had been requesting the very same for years. In early 2008 he decided to make available more of his unreleased 'performance catalogue' and thus Tertiary Noise was ushered in.\n\nHis 9th studio album, Wobble Factor would be unveiled later in 2008, and solidified Tipper's influence on the burgeoning 'glitch-hop' musical movement, especially in the United States.\n\nShortly after its release, his health demanded his immediate focus, curtailing his studio time and forcing cancellation of all tour dates. While recuperating over time, he laboured on his new ambient/downtempo LP, Broken Soul Jamboree. This album showcases many facets of Tipper's composition and production style, with striking artwork for the album cover and a limited edition poster accompanying the initial CD run.\n\nSince \"Broken Soul Jamboree,\" Dave Tipper has released four EPs (extended play). Each has featured midtempo glitch-hop and glitch-step, evolving and expanding upon the bank of vocal glitch sounds that created his signature sound (and in the opinion of many, the genre of glitch-hop itself). His notoriety has risen considerably in these years as well, and he was featured as a headlining act at multiple midsize electronic music festivals spanning the entire continental US (with an extensive showing on the West coast and making it as far East as North Carolina for Gnarnia Music and Arts festival in August 2012). At multiple music festivals in 2012 he played two sets, each distinctly different in terms of tempo and feel. His \"downtempo\" sets feature material mostly from \"Broken Soul Jamboree\" and earlier releases that are generally in-between 70 and 90 bpm and that feature heavy melodic composition. These are a rarity and only seem to occur when he plays two sets at a single event. If he is only contracted to play one set, it is consistently a midtempo glitch-hop set. There are unconfirmed rumours that in 2013 Dave Tipper will begin featuring more downtempo performances.\n\nIn 2013, Tipper announced he will only participate in two festival appearances due to health reasons; on 6 June, he underwent a successful mitral valve repair surgery.\n\nSites: BandCamp and Twitter <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tipper\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Destin Route (b. October 31, 1990), better known by the stage name JID, is an American rapper from Zone 6, Atlanta, Georgia. He describes himself as “a soft-spoken but intricate lyricist with a cocky side.” His stage name originates from “jittery,” his grandmother’s nickname for him due to his sporadic behavior as a child.\n\nHe first appeared on the Atlanta hip-hop scene with his debut EP, DiCaprio, in 2015. Growing up, JID's first connection with music was through his parents' collection of classic funk and soul LPs. After a stint at Hampton University playing football, JID also hooked up with fellow MCs as part of the Spillage Village collective. By 2012, he had dropped out of college to focus on music, and in 2014 he headed out on what would be a productive tour with EarthGang, Bas, and Ab-Soul. Touring allowed JID to craft his skills, and a year later he recorded and dropped the DiCaprio EP, which saw him team up with a host of producers, as well as EarthGang. While keen to distance himself from the generic abrasive trap sound that had dominated the Atlanta scene, JID wanted to deliver something that was more than just about a beat, and instead focused his time and effort on lyrics as well. In 2016, JID, alongside the rest of the Spillage Village crew, released the album Bears Like This Too Much, which saw the rapper honing his unique delivery and inspired lyrics. In 2017, he announced that he had signed to J. Cole's Dreamville label (a connection made with the rapper via JID's part in the 2014 tour with Bas and Cole's friend and producer Cedric Brown), which released the single Never and full-length The Never Story at the beginning of the year. In September of 2018, he issued the single \"151 Rum,\" the first offering from DiCaprio 2, his sophomore full-length and sequel to his 2015 EP. Later that year he released the album \"Dicaprio 2\".  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Joel Thomas Zimmerman (born January 5, 1981), better known as Deadmau5, is a Canadian progressive house, electro house and techno producer from Niagara Falls, Ontario. He is regarded as one of the world's most respected electronic music producers of modern times. In pop culture, he is known for wearing a large \"mau5head\" while performing at live events.\n\nThe Deadmau5 discography is currently comprised of eight studio albums, eight compilation albums, six mix albums, one soundtrack album, two remix albums, two video albums, seven extended plays, 55 singles, and 22 music videos.\n\nZimmerman's career in music began in 1999, releasing the vinyl pressed single \"I Don't Want No Other\" under Dred And Karma. Six years later, Deadmau5 released his debut studio album album, Get Scraped  on July 26, 2005, which featured more experimental genres different from his future sound. Within the following year, Zimmerman finished three compilation albums, Project 56, Deadmau5 Circa 1998–2002, and A Little Oblique, which were released on his (now retired) SectionZ page. \n\nOn November 6, 2006, he released his second studio album Vexillology, which marked the beginning of the signature Deadmau5 sound. In 2007, Zimmerman founded his own record label, Mau5trap, which released his third studio album Random Album Title on September 2, 2008. This was his first album to garner mainstream success, coining his unique style of progressive house and featuring the singles \"Faxing Berlin\", \"Not Exactly\" and \"I Remember\" (with Kaskade). \n\nDuring 2008, Zimmerman left Play Records. However, due to his contract agreement, Play Records was able to claim ownership of tracks he made during the time he was signed to the label. This led to the creation of the At Play series, which consisted of six mix albums released periodically from 2008 to 2015. \n\nOn September 22, 2009, Deadmau5 released his fourth studio album For Lack of a Better Name . In contrast of his previous album, For Lack of a Better Name  is based around tech house. Despite this switch in style, the album contains two of Zimmerman's greatest hits to date: \"Ghosts 'n' Stuff\" and \"Strobe\".  He expanded his EDM sound further with his fifth studio album, 4x4=12 which was released on December 6, 2010, and consisted of techno, electro house and the progressive house/dubstep mashup \"Raise Your Weapon\". In 2011, Deadmau5 released two non-album singles:  \"Aural Psynapse\" and \"HR 8938 Cephei\", with the former being a modern remake of an old song Zimmerman made under the alias Halcyon441.\n\nZimmerman revisited his roots with his sixth studio album, > Album Title Goes Here <, released on September 21, 2012. The album consists of house music along with songs in the ambient, glitch, and trip-hop genres. In November 2013, Zimmerman deleted three years worth of music from his SoundCloud account, replacing them with 7, an EP of seven melancholy piano sonatas named after the seven deadly sins. The same month, Zimmerman left Ultra Records and signed with record label Astralwerks.\n\nOn January 7, 2014, Deadmau5 announced on Twitter that his next project was complete. However, it was preceded by the weekly release of four singles, \"Avaritia\", \"Seeya\", \"Infra Turbo Pigcart Racer\" and \"Phantoms Can't Hang\" until his seventh studio album While(1<2) was finally released on June 17. After this, Zimmerman would leave Astralwerks and not release any new music until May 27, 2016, with the digital single \"Snowcone\". This song was later included on his eighth studio album W:/2016ALBUM/, which was released on  December 2, 2016.\n\nIn 2017, Deadmau5 would go on to release a compilation album of his older works, Stuff I Used to Do on January 7, and the single \"Legendary\" on August 25. On March 30, 2018, Zimmerman released Where's the Drop?, a compilation album containing orchestral covers of previously released music, with the exception of \"Caritas\", an entirely original song. From July 13, 2018 to February 1, 2019, Deadmau5 released the Mau5ville series, three EPs which featured original work along with remixes and songs by other Mau5trap artists. On January 25, 2019, the movie Polar premiered on Netflix, with Zimmerman releasing the soundtrack album, Polar (Music from the Netflix Film)  the same day. In November, Zimmerman released three new singles, entitled \"Satrn\", \"Coasted\" and \"Fall\", released on the 16th, 22nd and 29th, respectively.\n\nThe following year, Deadmau5 would continue to release singles, with \"Pomegranate\" on May 20 and \"Bridged By a Lightwave\" on November 10. Both are expected to appear on Zimmerman's next studio album. On March 29, 2021, Zimmerman debuted a new, house-focused record label called Hau5trap, and simultaneously released the single \"Nextra\". He would go on to release \"Hypnocurrency\" on April 22 and \"When the Summer Dies\" on July 15.\n\nThroughout his career, Deadmau5 has won 15 competitive awards and received 42 nominations. Amongst his major achievements, Zimmerman has won five Beatport Music Awards, four DJ Awards, three International Dance Music Awards, three Juno Awards, and has also received six Grammy Award nominations and one World Music Award nomination.\n\nZimmerman has also worked with a number of artists both underground and mainstream, including Melleefresh, Steve Duda, Kaskade, MC Flipside, Rob Swire of Pendulum,  Chris Lake, Glenn Morrison, Wolfgang Gartner, Sofi, Chris James, Cypress Hill, Imogen Heap, Gerard Way, Colleen D'Agostino, Grabbitz, Attlas, Shotty Horroh, Lights, Mr. Bill, The Neptunes, Kiesza, and Rezz.\n\nThe name Deadmau5 originates from an incident where a mouse crawled into his computer and died. He posted this story on an internet forum, and members began calling him TheDeadMouseGuy. \"Dead Mouse\" was too long for an IRC login name, so he abbreviated it to \"deadmau5\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/deadmau5\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Michael Franti (born April 21, 1967 in Oakland, CA) is a gifted and much-heralded spoken word artist and political activist from San Francisco, CA. As leader of the politically and socially-charged group Spearhead, Franti is at the forefront of hip-hop's renaissance, expanding the music's boundaries as he draws on funk and soul-driven beats. Through his music and poetry, Franti tackles a range of issues--the criminal justice system, corporatization of our daily lives, AIDS, gay rights, homelessness, the death penalty, drug addiction and suicide.\n\nHis project Spearhead produced the critically acclaimed Home in 1994. The album contained his biggest single, \"Hole in the Bucket,\" a thoughtful lament on the plight of the homeless, and \"Positive,\" which addressed the growing AIDS epidemic. The album boasted adept funk samplings, sinuous guitar vamps, and soulful, melodic tracks about family and social injustice. 1997's Chocolate Supa Highway was not as pop-friendly as Home, but neither did its themes of kidnappings and police brutality lend themselves to such overt accessibility. Its mixture of harsher musical styles -- techno, rock, and funk -- was a step forward for Franti as his world view broadened and deepened. In 2001, Franti released Stay Human. In it he expresses his anger at the system, his advocacy of love, and his belief in freedom through individuality and self-expression through a set of songs that revolve around a fictitious death penalty case. In it, his embrace of the genres that inspired him is achieved with eloquence. \n\nEarlier projects of Franti include The Beatnigs and The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, which had more of an experimental/industrial sound, but addressed many of the same social/political issues.\n\nAs a celebration of the Election of Barack Obama Franti recorded the Obama Song, offered as a free track on downloaded at their offical website, www.michaelfranti.com/.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Franti+&+Spearhead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Andrew Bird (born July 11, 1973) is an American musician. He was born in Lake Bluff, Illinois and resides in the Chicago area. Bird is a singer, a violinist and, since 2004, a guitarist. He is also an accomplished whistler.\n\nHis early work, which echoed gypsy jazz and traditional folk, has led into his current sound, which mixes rock with more broad compositions. His years of solo song-craft have now enabled him to produce a sound that is uniquely his own.\n\nTrained by the Suzuki method from a young age and a graduate of Illinois' Northwestern University, Bird released his first solo album, Music of Hair, in  1996. Vastly different from his later releases, this first album showcases his violin skills and pays tribute to his fascination with both American and European folk traditions, as well as jazz and blues.\n\nHis initial commercial exposure was in collaborative work with the band Squirrel Nut Zippers. He was quickly lumped in with the swing craze that swept the United States music industry in the mid '90s; this is an affiliation that he is still working to shed.\n\nTaking on the role of band leader in 1997 with Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire, he released the album Thrills. This was followed by Oh! The Grandeur in 1998. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional folk, pre-war jazz and swing, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument.\n\nIn 2001, Bird released The Swimming Hour, his third release with the Bowl of Fire and a dramatic departure from previous recordings. The Swimming Hour featured a mixture of styles, from the zydeco-influenced \"Core and Rind\" to more straightforward rock songs. He has often referred to this record as his \"jukebox album\".\n\nThe Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded some time in 2003, having featured many skilled Chicago musicians including Kevin O'Donnell, Nora O'Connor, Andy Hopkins (aka Mr. Rudy Day), Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn and Ryan Hembrey.\n\nBird then released two subsequent solo albums, both distributed through the label operated by Ani DiFranco, Righteous Babe Records. The two records, 2003's Weather Systems and 2005's The Mysterious Production of Eggs, continue a progression towards an eclectic indie folk sound that has proven challenging to classify.\n\nBird's live solo shows have been notable in that he uses a multi-track system to sample and loop his own performance. For example, he may record a snippet of his performance on violin, then play a \"loop\" of that sound. This provides a more full-bodied sound and aurally suggests a band performance, rather than the sound of a solo artist.\n\nBird's next full-length album Armchair Apocrypha (Fat Possum) was released on March 20th 2007.\n\nNovember 2007 saw the Soldier On EP originally a European tour-only release. But due to high demand and unanticipated critical acclaim was released digitally and in CD-format on both sides of the Atlantic. Critics and fans alike have hearkened to the EP's first track, \"The Trees Were Mistaken\", a complex yet austere looping composition that marks a departure from Bird's earlier body of work. It also contains a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Oh Sister\".\n\nJanuary 2009 saw Noble Beast, also available with instrumental album Useless Creatures, released worldwide to positive reviews.\n\nThe Fatal Shore Songfacts reports that Break it Yourself, Bird's sixth solo studio album, was released on March 6, 2012 through Mom+Pop records in the US and Bella Union in the UK. The origins of the LP lie in a couple of jam sessions by a gathering of Bird's friends in the singer's western Illinois barn, near the banks of the Mississippi River.\n\nOf his 2019 album My Finest Work Yet, Talia Schlanger of NPR says \"Bird zooms way out on humanity across history's timeline, seeking insight about our current age, in a way he hopes 'stays above the news feed noise.'\"  Many tracks, including the opener \"Sisyphus,\" include Andrew's trademark whistling. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Bird\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Los Lobos is a Mexican-American rock band from East Los Angeles, California, USA, heavily influenced by rock and roll, Tex-Mex, country music, folk, blues, and traditional Spanish / Mexican music such as boleros and norteño.\n\nVocalist/guitarist David Hidalgo and drummer Louie Pérez met at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles, and bonded over their mutual affinity for obscure musical acts such as Fairport Convention, Randy Newman and Ry Cooder. Pérez recalls, \"We’re looking at each other, 'You like this stuff? I thought I was the only weird one.' So I went over to his house one day for about a year, which we spent listening to records, playing guitars, and starting to write songs.\" The two borrowed reel-to-reel recorders from a friend and created multi-track recordings of music spanning from parody songs to free-form jazz. They later enlisted fellow students Cesar Rosas and Conrad Lozano to complete the group's line-up in 1973.\n\n\nFormed in the late 1970's, band members Dave Hidalgo, Cesar Rojas, Steve Berlin, Louie Pérez and Conrad Lozano became the bellwether for Mexican-American music in the U.S. when they recorded the music for \"La Bamba\" in 1987, which added popular acclaim to the critical praise they had received for their 1984 album \"How Will the Wolf Survive?\".\n\nThey have since become one of the mainstays of the Latin music scene as well as rock music in general, staying together through over 20 albums, and for almost three decades, through changing music climate and personal tragedies, they've continued cranking out albums and touring to dedicated fans. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Los+Lobos\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Los Lobos is a Mexican-American rock band from East Los Angeles, California, USA, heavily influenced by rock and roll, Tex-Mex, country music, folk, blues, and traditional Spanish / Mexican music such as boleros and norteño.\n\nVocalist/guitarist David Hidalgo and drummer Louie Pérez met at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles, and bonded over their mutual affinity for obscure musical acts such as Fairport Convention, Randy Newman and Ry Cooder. Pérez recalls, \"We’re looking at each other, 'You like this stuff? I thought I was the only weird one.' So I went over to his house one day for about a year, which we spent listening to records, playing guitars, and starting to write songs.\" The two borrowed reel-to-reel recorders from a friend and created multi-track recordings of music spanning from parody songs to free-form jazz. They later enlisted fellow students Cesar Rosas and Conrad Lozano to complete the group's line-up in 1973.\n\n\nFormed in the late 1970's, band members Dave Hidalgo, Cesar Rojas, Steve Berlin, Louie Pérez and Conrad Lozano became the bellwether for Mexican-American music in the U.S. when they recorded the music for \"La Bamba\" in 1987, which added popular acclaim to the critical praise they had received for their 1984 album \"How Will the Wolf Survive?\".\n\nThey have since become one of the mainstays of the Latin music scene as well as rock music in general, staying together through over 20 albums, and for almost three decades, through changing music climate and personal tragedies, they've continued cranking out albums and touring to dedicated fans. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Los+Lobos\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

    "headlinerBio": "Goo Goo Dolls is an alternative rock band formed in 1985 in Buffalo, New York, USA by guitarist/vocalist John Rzeznik and bassist/vocalist Robby Takac initially under the name the Sex Maggots (the new name was chosen from an ad in True Detective magazine at the behest of a local club owner). They are most famous for the hit \"Iris\", featured on the soundtrack to the 1998 film City of Angels. Currently, the band consists of John Rzeznik (guitar, vocals) and Robby Takac (vocals, bass). The band has sold 12 million records worldwide and won two Grammy Awards.\n\nEarly in their career, the Goo Goo Dolls were frequently dismissed by critics as mere imitators of The Replacements; however, the band refined its sound to be more mainstream, which helped it become one of the most popular adult alternative rock bands of the latter half of the '90s, selling millions of records to audiences largely unfamiliar with their inspirations. That's no bitch on the band, either -- their music simply improved in craft and accessibility as the years progressed, and radio happened to be receptive to what a decade earlier would have been considered collegiate power pop. Thus, the band landed two huge hits with the acoustic ballads \"Name\" and \"Iris.\"\n\nOriginally a cover band with a taste for power pop and classic rock & roll, the group soon began writing its own songs. Their early sound recalled the The Replacements' origins as a bratty punk band (circa Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash) -- melodic, snotty, and a little bit thrashy. That sound was the reason the band attracted the interest of the heavy metal label Metal Blade, which issued their debut album in 1987 (known either as The Goo Goo girls or First Release). 1989's Jed continued in a similar vein; the college radio breakthrough came with 1990's Hold Me Up, a Replacements-ish power pop record.\n\n1993's Superstar Car Wash was the Goo Goo Dolls' artistic breakthrough; though it did nothing to quell the Replacements comparisons, it was a finely crafted pop/rock record, and its lead single, \"We Are the Normal,\" was co-written with Replacements leader Paul Westerberg himself. Still, Superstar Car Wash wasn't the commercial force the band hoped it would be, especially in light of the success of similar bands like the Gin Blossoms. That all changed with 1995's A Boy Named Goo, when an L.A. rock station put the acoustic-driven ballad \"Name\" into heavy rotation. It was eventually released as a single nationwide, and went Top Five late in the year; platinum sales for the album followed close behind. Unfortunately, the original drummer was no longer around to enjoy the band's success; prior to the album's release, he'd been sacked and replaced by drummer Mike Malinin.\n\nDissatisfied with the royalty rates in their Metal Blade contract, the band waged a legal battle that wound up allowing them to jump to parent company Warner Brothers. Somewhat drained, Rzeznik and the band shook off a case of writer's block to contribute the ballad \"Iris\" to the soundtrack of the 1998 americanized version of City of Angels (Featuring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan). Appearing that April, the song was a monster smash, although it was never released as a single (so its official Top Ten pop chart status doesn't convey how popular it was); for a better indicator, \"Iris\" spent nearly a year on Billboard's airplay charts, including an astonishing 18 weeks at number one, and was nominated for three Grammys. The band's next album, Dizzy Up the Girl, was released in September, during the middle of \"Iris\"'s marathon airplay run, and sold over three million copies. Its clean, polished sound completed the Goo Goo Dolls' transformation into mainstream pop/rockers who happened to have alternative roots. Further hits from the record followed over the next year, including \"Slide,\" \"Dizzy,\" and the Grammy-nominated \"Black Balloon,\" and the band toured heavily in support. The Goo Goo Dolls revamped their sound for 2001's career retrospective, Ego, Opinion, Art & Commerce. A year later, the trio hit the charts with \"Here Is Gone\" from their seventh studio album, Gutterflower. The CD/DVD combo Live in Buffalo: July 4, 2004 helped fans endure the long wait for the band's next studio album, Let Love In, which didn't appear until 2006. The band toured through the summer of 2007. The band released the first of two greatest hits compilation, entitled Greatest Hits Volume One: The Singles, November 13th 2007. \n\nIn February 2008, the band officially headed into studio to work on their new record.\nIn August 2010, the band released their ninth album, Something for the Rest of Us. In June 2013, the band's tenth studio album, Magnetic, was released. In December 2013, drummer Mike Malinin announced that he left the band.\n\nIn May 2016, the band released their eleventh studio album, Boxes. The Goo Goo Dolls' 12th studio album, Miracle Pill, was released on September 13, 2019.\n\nSingles:\nThere You Are (Hold Me Up)\nJust the Way You Are (Hold Me Up)\nI'm Awake Now (Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Soundtrack)\nWe Are the Normal (Superstar Car Wash)\nFallin' Down (Superstar Car Wash)\nOnly One (A Boy Named Goo)\nFlat Top (A Boy Named Goo)\nName (A Boy Named Goo)\nLong Way Down (A Boy Named Goo)\nNaked (A Boy Named Goo)\nLazy Eye (Batman & Robin Soundtrack)\nIris (City of Angels Soundtrack/Dizzy Up the Girl)\nSlide (Dizzy Up the Girl)\nBlack Balloon (Dizzy Up the Girl)\nDizzy (Dizzy Up the Girl)\nBroadway (Dizzy Up the Girl)\nHere Is Gone (Gutterflower)\nBig Machine (Gutterflower)\nSympathy (Gutterflower)\nGive A Little Bit (Live in Buffalo: July 4, 2004/Let Love In)\nBetter Days (Target's Sounds of the Season/Let Love In)\nStay With You (Let Love In)\nLet Love In (Let Love In)\nBefore It's Too Late (Sam & Mikaela's Theme) (Transformers Soundtrack)\nHome (Something for the Rest of Us)\nReal (AT&T Team USA Soundtrack)\nNot Broken (Something For The Rest Of Us) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Goo+Goo+Dolls\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
